            <seg xml:id="C07e_app18-f1831_start"/>Geneva. <seg xml:id="C07e_app18-f1831_end"/>He was a boy of singular talent <seg xml:id="C07e_app24-f1831_start"/>and fancy. He loved enterprise, hardship, even danger, for its own sake. <seg xml:id="C07e_app24-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C07e_app37-f1831_start"/>He was deeply read <seg xml:id="C07e_app37-f1831_end"/>in books of <seg xml:id="C07e_app39-f1831_start"/>chivalry and romance. He composed heroic songs, and began to write many a tale of enchantment and knightly adventure. <seg xml:id="C07e_app39-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C07e_app44-f1831_start"/>He tried to make us act plays, and to enter into masquerades, the characters were drawn from the heroes of Roncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels.&lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p2"/&gt;<seg xml:id="C07e_app44-f1831_end"/>

My parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence. We felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights which we enjoyed. When I mingled with other families, I distinctly discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted the developement of filial love.&lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p3"/&gt; <seg xml:id="C07e_app54-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C07e_app131-f1831_start"/>&lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p4"/&gt;My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some law in my temperature they were turned, not towards childish pursuits, but to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things indiscriminately. I confess that neither the structure of languages, nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states, possessed attractions for me. It was the secrets of heaven and earth that I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of things, or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me, still my enquiries were directed to the metaphysical, or, in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.&lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p4"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p5"/&gt;Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral relations of things. The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes, and the actions of men, were his theme; and his hope and his dream was to become one among those &lt;pb xml:id="F1831_v_041" n="25"/&gt;whose names are recorded in story, as the gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species. The saintly soul of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home. Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of her celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us. She was the living spirit of love to soften and attract: I might have become sullen in my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness. And Clerval—could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval?—yet he might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his generosity—so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of beneficence, and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring ambition.&lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p5"/&gt;<seg xml:id="C07e_app131-f1831_end"/>
