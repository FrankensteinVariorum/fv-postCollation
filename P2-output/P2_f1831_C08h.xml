As he went on, I felt as if my soul were grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were touched which formed the mechanism of my being: chord after chord was sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception, one purpose. So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of Frankenstein,—more, far more, will I achieve: treading in the steps already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.&lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p17"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p18"/&gt;I closed not my eyes that night. My internal being was in a state of insurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I had no power to produce it. By degrees, after the morning’s dawn, sleep came. I awoke, and my yesternight’s thoughts were as a dream. There only &lt;pb xml:id="F1831_v_051" n="35"/&gt;remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies, and to devote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a natural talent. <seg xml:id="C08h_app1-f1831_end"/>
