            <seg xml:id="C07a_app15-f1831_start"/>the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot refrain from relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a merchant, who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a proud and unbending disposition, and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and magni&lt;pb n="19" xml:id="F1831_v_035"/&gt;ficence. Having paid his debts, therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in wretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship, and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances. He <seg xml:id="C07a_app15-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C07a_app16-f1831_start"/>bitterly deplored <seg xml:id="C07a_app16-f1831_end"/>

            <seg xml:id="C07a_app18-f1831_start"/>false pride which led his friend to a conduct so little worthy <seg xml:id="C07a_app18-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C07a_app19-f1831_start"/>of <seg xml:id="C07a_app19-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C07a_app20-f1831_start"/>the affection that united them. He lost no time in endeavouring <seg xml:id="C07a_app20-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C07a_app21-f1831_start"/>to seek him <seg xml:id="C07a_app21-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C07a_app22-f1831_start"/>out, <seg xml:id="C07a_app22-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C07a_app23-f1831_start"/>with the hope of persuading <seg xml:id="C07a_app23-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C07a_app24-f1831_start"/>him to begin the world again through his credit and assistance.&lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p2"/&gt;&lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p3"/&gt;Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself; and it was ten months before my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery, he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street, near the Reuss. But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes; but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in the mean time he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a merchant’s house. The interval <seg xml:id="C07a_app24-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C07a_app25-f1831_start"/>was, consequently, <seg xml:id="C07a_app25-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C07a_app26-f1831_start"/>spent in inaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling, when he had leisure for reflection; and at length it took so fast hold of his mind, that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.&lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p3"/&gt;&lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p4"/&gt;His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness; but she saw with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing, and that there was no other prospect of support. But Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould; and her courage rose to support her in her adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw; and by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life.&lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p4"/&gt;&lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p5"/&gt;Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving her an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her; and she knelt by Beaufort’s coffin, weeping bitterly, when my father entered the chamber. He came like a protecting spirit to the &lt;pb n="20" xml:id="F1831_v_036"/&gt;poor girl, who committed herself to his <seg xml:id="C07a_app26-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C07a_app27-f1831_start"/>care; <seg xml:id="C07a_app27-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C07a_app28-f1831_start"/>and after the interment of his <seg xml:id="C07a_app28-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C07a_app29-f1831_start"/>friend, <seg xml:id="C07a_app29-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C07a_app30-f1831_start"/>he conducted her to Geneva, and placed her under the protection of a relation. Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.&lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p5"/&gt; <seg xml:id="C07a_app30-f1831_end"/>
