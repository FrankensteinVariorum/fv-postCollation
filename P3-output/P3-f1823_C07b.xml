Of these I was the eldest, and the destined suc<pb n="44" xml:id="F1823_v1_063"/>cessor to all his labours and utility. No creature could have more tender parents than mine. My improvement and health were their constant care, especially as I remained for several years their only child. But before I continue my narrative, I must record an incident which took place when I was four years of age.<p th:eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p6"/>
            <p th:sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p7"/>My father had a sister, whom he tenderly loved, and who had married early in life an Italian gentleman. Soon after her marriage, she had accompanied her husband into <seg xml:id="C07b_app6-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C07b_app7-f1823_start"/>his <seg xml:id="C07b_app7-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C07b_app8-f1823_start"/>native country, and for some years my father had very little communication with her. About the time I mentioned she died; and a few months afterwards he received a letter from her husband, acquainting him with his intention of marrying an Italian lady, and requesting my father to take charge of the in<pb n="45" xml:id="F1823_v1_064"/>fant Elizabeth, the only child of his deceased sister. “It is my wish,” he said, "that you should consider her as your own daughter, and educate her thus. Her <seg xml:id="C07b_app8-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C07b_app9-f1823_start"/>mother's <seg xml:id="C07b_app9-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C07b_app10-f1823_start"/>fortune is secured to her, the documents of which I will commit to your keeping. Reflect upon this proposition; and decide whether you would prefer educating your niece yourself to her being brought up by a stepmother.”<p th:eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p7"/>
            <p th:sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p8"/>My father did not hesitate, and immediately went to Italy, that he might accompany the little Elizabeth to her future home. I have often heard my mother say, that she was at that time the most beautiful child she had ever seen, and <seg xml:id="C07b_app10-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C07b_app11-f1823_start"/>showed <seg xml:id="C07b_app11-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C07b_app12-f1823_start"/>signs even then <seg xml:id="C07b_app12-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C07b_app13-f1823_start"/>of a gentle and affectionate disposition. These indications, and a desire to bind as closely as possible the ties of domestic love, determined my mother to consider Elizabeth <pb n="46" xml:id="F1823_v1_065"/>as my future wife; a design which she never found reason to repent.<p th:eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p8"/>
            <p th:sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p9"/>From this time Elizabeth Lavenza became my playfellow, and, as we grew older, my friend. She was docile and good tempered, yet gay and playful as a summer insect. Although she was lively and animated, her feelings were strong and deep, and her disposition uncommonly affectionate. No one could better enjoy liberty, yet no one could submit with more grace than she did to constraint and caprice. Her imagination was luxuriant, yet her capability of application was great. Her person was the image of her mind; her hazel eyes, although as lively as a bird’s, possessed an attractive softness. Her figure was light and airy; and, though capable of enduring great fatigue, she appeared the most fragile creature in the world. While I admired her under<pb n="47" xml:id="F1823_v1_066"/>standing and fancy, I loved to tend on her, as I should on a favourite animal; and I never saw so much grace both of person and mind united to so little pretension.<p th:eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p9"/>
