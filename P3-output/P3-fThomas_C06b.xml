He appeared pleased with the confidence, and suggested several alterations in my plan, which I shall find exceedingly useful. There is no pedantry in his manner; but all he does appears to spring solely from the interest he instinctively takes in the welfare of those who surround him. He is often overcome by <seg xml:id="C06b_app1-fThomas_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06b_app2-fThomas_start"/>a gloom, <seg xml:id="C06b_app2-fThomas_end"/>

            <del th:sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p27_del1"/>and then he sits by himself, and tries to overcome all that is sullen or unsocial in his humour. These paroxysms pass from him like a cloud from before the sun, though his dejection never leaves him.<del th:eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p27_del1"/> 
            <add th:sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p27_add2"/>Which veils his countenance like deep nightâ€”he neither speaks or notices anything around him, but sitting on a gun will gaze on the sea and I have sometimes observed his dark eyelash wet with a tear which falls <del th:sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p27_add2_del1"/>silently<del th:eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p27_add2_del1"/> silently in the deep. This unobtrusive sorrow excites in me the most painful interest, and he will at times reward my sympathy by throwing aside this veil of mortal woe, and then his ardent looks, his deep toned voice and powerful eloquence entrance me with delight.<add th:eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p27_add2"/>
