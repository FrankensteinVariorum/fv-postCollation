            <seg xml:id="C06b_app1-f1818_start"/>asked me many questions concerning my design; and I have related my little history frankly to him. He appeared pleased with the confidence, and suggested several alterations in my plan, which I shall find exceedingly useful. There is no pedantry in his manner; but all he does appears to spring solely from the interest he instinctively takes in the welfare of those who surround him. He is often overcome by <seg xml:id="C06b_app1-f1818_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06b_app2-f1818_start"/>gloom, <seg xml:id="C06b_app2-f1818_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06b_app3-f1818_start"/>and then he sits by himself, and tries to overcome all that is sullen or unsocial in his humour. These paroxysms pass from him like a cloud from before the sun, though his dejection never leaves him. <seg xml:id="C06b_app3-f1818_end"/>
