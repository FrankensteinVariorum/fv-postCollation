Dear Victor, banish these dark passions. Remember the friends around you, <pb xml:id="F1831_v_094" n="78"/>who centre all their hopes in you. Have we lost the power of rendering you happy?

I was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial influence could penetrate. The wounded deer dragging its fainting limbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow which had pierced it, and to die—was but a type of me.</p>
                        <p xml:id="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p12">Sometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me: but sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek, by bodily exercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerable sensations. It was during an access of this kind that I suddenly left my home, and bending my steps towards the near Alpine valleys, sought in the magnificence, the eternity of such scenes, to forget myself and my ephemeral, because human, sorrows. My wanderings were directed towards the valley of Chamounix. I had visited it frequently during my boyhood. Six years had passed since then: <hi xml:id="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p12_hi1">I</hi> was a wreck—but nought had changed in those savage and enduring scenes. </p>
