The lady was dressed in a dark suit, and covered with a thick black veil. Agatha asked a question; to which the stranger only replied by pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix. Her voice was musical, but unlike that of <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_075" n="071"/>either of my friends. On hearing this word, Felix came up hastily to the lady; who, when she saw him, threw up her veil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression. Her hair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were dark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular proportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with a lovely pink. </p>

She appeared affected by different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_076" n="072"/>she held out her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously, and called her, as well as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian.

Felix seemed <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_077" n="073"/>peculiarly happy, and with smiles of delight welcomed his Arabian. Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed the hands of the lovely stranger; and, pointing to her brother, made signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came. Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances, expressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend. Presently I found, by the frequent recurrence of</seg>

When they separated, Felix kissed the hand of the stranger, and said, ‘Good night, sweet Safie.’ He sat up much longer, conversing with his father; and, by the frequent repetition of her name, I conjectured that their lovely guest was the subject of their conversation. I ardently desired to understand them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but found it utterly impossible. </p>
                        <p xml:id="novel1_letter4_chapter12_div4_div13_p8"> “The next morning Felix went out to his work; and, after the usual occupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the old man, and, taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly beautiful, that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes. She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or dying away, like a nightingale of the woods. </p>

She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger. The old man appeared enraptured, and said some words, which Agatha endeavoured to explain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music. </p>

Her voice was musical, but unlike that of <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_075" n="071"/>either of my friends. On hearing this word, Felix came up hastily to the lady; who, when she saw him, threw up her veil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression.

She appeared affected by different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_076" n="072"/>she held out her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously, and called her, as well as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian.

She appeared affected by different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_076" n="072"/>she held out her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously, and called her, as well as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian.

She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or dying away, like a nightingale of the woods. </p>
