"before i come on board your vessel," said he, "will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?" <p-end/> <p-start/> you may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction, and to whom i should have supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford. i replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the northern pole. <p-end/> <p-start/> upon hearing this he appeared satisfied, and consented to come on board. good god! margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety, your surprise would have been boundless. his limbs were nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering. i never saw a man in so wretched a condition. we attempted to carry him into the cabin; but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air, he fainted. we accordingly brought him back to the deck, and restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy, and forcing him to swallow a small quantity. as soon as he	NoRG	 	NoRG	 	NoRG

her hazel eyes, although as lively as a bird’s, possessed an attractive softness. her figure was light and airy; and, though capable of enduring great fatigue, she appeared the most fragile creature in the world. while i admired her understanding and fancy, i loved to tend on her, as i should on a favourite animal; and i never saw so much grace both of person and mind united to so little pretension. <p-end/>	C07_app38_rg2	<p-start/>there was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents but this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection. there was a sense of justice in my father’s upright mind which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love strongly. perhaps during former years he had suffered from the late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth. there was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother differing wholly from the doating fondness of age for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a desire to be the means of in some degree recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her. every thing was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience. he strove to shelter her as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener from every rougher wind and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and benevolent mind. her health and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit had been shaken by what she had gone through. during the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of italy and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders as a restorative for her weakened frame.<p-end/> <p-start/>from italy they visited germany and france. i their eldest child was born at naples and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. i remained for several years their only child. much as they were attached to each other they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me. my mother’s tender caresses and my father’s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my first recollections. i was their plaything and their idol and something better—their child the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by heaven whom to bring up to good and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery according as they fulfilled their duties towards me. with this deep consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had given life added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both it may be imagined that while during every hour of my infant life i received a lesson of patience of charity and of self-control i was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but one train of enjoyment to me.<p-end/> <p-start/>for a long time i was their only care. my mother had much desire to have a daughter but i continued their single offspring. when i was about five years old while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of italy they passed a week on the shores of the lake of como. their benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor. this to my mother was more than a duty; it was a necessity a passion,—remembering what she had suffered and how she had been relieved,—for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the afflicted. during one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate while the number of half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst shape. one day when my father had gone by himself to milan my mother accompanied by me visited this abode. she found a peasant and his wife hard working bent down by care and labour distributing a scanty meal to five hungry babes. among these there was one which attracted my mother far above all the rest. she appeared of a different stock. the four others were dark-eyed hardy little vagrants; this child was thin and very fair. her hair was the brightest living gold and despite the poverty of her clothing seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head. her brow was clear and ample her blue eyes cloudless and her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold her without looking on her as of a distinct species a being heaven-sent and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.<p-end/> <p-start/> the peasant woman perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and admiration on this lovely girl eagerly communicated her history. she was not her child but the daughter of a milanese nobleman. her mother was a german and had died on giving her birth. the infant had been placed with these good people to nurse: they were better off then. they had not been long married and their eldest child was but just born. the father of their charge was one of those italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory of italy,—one among the <hi>schiavi ognor frementi</hi> who exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his country. he became the victim of its weakness. whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of austria was not known. his property was confiscated his child became an orphan and a beggar. she continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude abode fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.<p-end/> <p-start/>when my father returned from milan he found playing with me in the hall of our villa a child fairer than pictured cherub—a creature who seemed to shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter than the chamois of the hills. the apparition was soon explained. with his permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their charge to her. they were fond of the sweet orphan. her presence had seemed a blessing to them; but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty and want when providence afforded her such powerful protection. they consulted their village priest and the result was that elizabeth lavenza became the inmate of my parents’ house—my more than sister—the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and my pleasures.<p-end/>	NoRG	 	NoRG
