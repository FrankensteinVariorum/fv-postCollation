I felt the greatest eagerness to hear the promised narrative, partly from curiosity, and partly from a strong desire to ameliorate his fate, if it were in my power. I expressed these feelings in my answer.&lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p36"/&gt;&lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p37"/&gt;“I thank you,” he replied, “for your sympathy, but it is useless; my fate is nearly fulfilled. I wait but for one event, and then I shall repose in peace. I understand your feeling,” continued he, perceiving that I wished to interrupt him; “but you are mistaken, my friend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my destiny: listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is <seg xml:id="C06h_app4-f1831_end"/>

            <seg xml:id="C06h_app8-f1831_start"/>to record, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during the day. If I should be engaged, I will at least make notes. This manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest <seg xml:id="C06h_app8-f1831_end"/>

Strange and harrowing must be his story; frightful the storm which embraced the gallant vessel on its course, and wrecked it—thus!&lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p38"/&gt; <seg xml:id="C06h_app11-f1831_end"/>
