    the cause of their

    for some reason which I could not 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C20_app64-f1831_start"/&gt;
        learn, he became
        &lt;seg xml:id="C20_app64-f1831_end"/&gt;
    obnoxious to the

        tried,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C20_app68-f1831_end"/&gt;

    his horror and 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C20_app83-f1831_start"/&gt;
        indignation were uncontrollable,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C20_app83-f1831_end"/&gt;
    when he heard the

        decision of the court.

        him,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C20_app91-f1831_end"/&gt;
    and then looked around for the means. After many fruitless attempts to gain admittance to the

        prison,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C20_app93-f1831_end"/&gt;

        strongly
        &lt;seg xml:id="C20_app95-f1831_end"/&gt;
    grated window in an unguarded part of the

        chains,
