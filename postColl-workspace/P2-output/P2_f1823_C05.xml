            <seg xml:id="C05_app5-f1823_start"/>although it is very probable that you will see me before these papers can come into your possession. &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p2"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p3"/&gt; Last Monday (July 31st), we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the<seg xml:id="C05_app5-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C05_app6-f1823_start"/>sea room<seg xml:id="C05_app6-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C05_app7-f1823_start"/>in which she floated. Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we were compassed round by a very thick fog. We accordingly lay to, hoping that some change would &lt;pb xml:id="F1823_v1_041" n="21"/&gt;take place in the atmosphere and weather. &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p3"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p4"/&gt; About two o’clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out in every direction, vast and irregular<seg xml:id="C05_app7-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C05_app8-f1823_start"/>plains of ice, which seemed to have no end. Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly attracted our attention, and diverted our solicitude from our own situation. We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile: a being which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature, sat in the sledge, and guided the dogs. We watched the rapid progress of the traveller with our telescopes, until he was lost among the distant inequalities of the ice. &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p4"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p5"/&gt; &lt;pb xml:id="F1823_v1_042" n="23"/&gt;This appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as we believed, many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by ice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the greatest attention.<seg xml:id="C05_app8-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C05_app9-f1823_start"/>&lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p5"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p6"/&gt; About two hours after this occurrence, we heard the ground sea; and before night the ice broke, and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until the morning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which float about after the breaking up of the ice. I profited of this time to rest for a few hours. &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p6"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p7"/&gt; In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck, and found all the sailors busy on one side of &lt;pb xml:id="F1823_v1_043" n="24"/&gt;the vessel, apparently talking to some one in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night, on a large fragment of ice. Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human being within it, whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel. He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island, but an European. When I appeared on deck, the master said, “Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea.” &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p7"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p8"/&gt; On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a foreign accent. “Before I come on board your vessel,” said he, “will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?” &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p8"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p9"/&gt; You may conceive my astonishment &lt;pb xml:id="F1823_v1_044" n="25"/&gt;on hearing such a question addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction, and to whom I should have supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford. I replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the northern pole. &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p9"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p10"/&gt; Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied, and consented to come on board. Good God! Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety, your surprise would have been boundless. His limbs were nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering. I never saw a man in so wretched a condition. We attempted to carry him into the cabin; but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air, he fainted. We accordingly brought &lt;pb xml:id="F1823_v1_045" n="26"/&gt;him back to the deck, and restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy, and forcing him to swallow a small quantity. As soon as he<seg xml:id="C05_app9-f1823_end"/>

            <seg xml:id="C05_app13-f1823_start"/>we wrapped him up in blankets, and placed him near the chimney of the<seg xml:id="C05_app13-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C05_app14-f1823_start"/>kitchen-stove.<seg xml:id="C05_app14-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C05_app15-f1823_start"/>By slow degrees he recovered, and ate a little soup, which restored him wonderfully. &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p10"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p11"/&gt; Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak; and I often feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding. When he had in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin, and attended on him as much as my duty would permit. I never saw a more interesting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of wildness, and even madness; but there are moments when, if any one performs an act of kindness towards him, or does &lt;pb xml:id="F1823_v1_046" n="27"/&gt;him any the most trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with a beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he is generally melancholy and despairing; and sometimes he gnashes his teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him. &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p11"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p12"/&gt; When my guest was a little recovered, I had great trouble to keep off the men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose. Once, however, the lieutenant asked, Why he had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle? &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p12"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p13"/&gt; His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom; and he &lt;pb xml:id="F1823_v1_047" n="28"/&gt;replied, “To seek one who fled from me.” &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p13"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p14"/&gt; “And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?” &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p14"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p15"/&gt; “Yes.” &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p15"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p16"/&gt; “Then I fancy we have seen him;<seg xml:id="C05_app15-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C05_app16-f1823_start"/>for,<seg xml:id="C05_app16-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C05_app17-f1823_start"/>the day before we picked you up, we saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.” &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p16"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p17"/&gt; This aroused the stranger’s attention; and he asked a multitude of questions concerning the route which the dæmon, as he called him, had pursued. Soon after, when he was alone with me, he<seg xml:id="C05_app17-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C05_app18-f1823_start"/>said, “I<seg xml:id="C05_app18-f1823_end"/>

            <seg xml:id="C05_app22-f1823_start"/>inquired<seg xml:id="C05_app22-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C05_app23-f1823_start"/>if I thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed the other sledge? I replied, that I could not answer with any degree of certainty; for the ice had not broken until near midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety before that time; but of this I could not judge. &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p20"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p21"/&gt; From this time<seg xml:id="C05_app23-f1823_end"/>

            <seg xml:id="C05_app26-f1823_start"/>to be upon deck, to watch for the sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere.<seg xml:id="C05_app26-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C05_app27-f1823_start"/>But<seg xml:id="C05_app27-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C05_app28-f1823_start"/>I have promised that some one should watch for him, and give him instant notice if any new object should appear in sight. &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p21"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p22"/&gt; &lt;pb xml:id="F1823_v1_049" n="30"/&gt;Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the present day. The stranger has gradually improved in health, but is very silent, and appears uneasy when any one except myself enters his cabin. Yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle, that the sailors are all interested in him, although they have had very little communication with him. For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother; and his constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion. He must have been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck so attractive and amiable. &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p22"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p23"/&gt; I said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend on the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had been broken by misery, I should have been &lt;pb xml:id="F1823_v1_050" n="31"/&gt;happy to have possessed as the brother of my heart. &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p23"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p24"/&gt; I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals, should I have any fresh incidents to record. &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p24"/&gt;<seg xml:id="C05_app28-f1823_end"/>
