Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and the diversity and contrast that subsisted <seg xml:id="C07d_app12-f1831_end"/>in our <seg xml:id="C07d_app17-f1831_start"/>characters drew us nearer together. Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated disposition; but, with all my ardour, <seg xml:id="C07d_app17-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C07d_app24-f1831_start"/>I was capable of a more intense application, and <seg xml:id="C07d_app24-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C07d_app25-f1831_start"/>was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge.<seg xml:id="C07d_app25-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C07d_app26-f1831_start"/>She busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets; and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss home—the sublime shapes of the mountains; the changes of the seasons; tempest and calm; the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of our Alpine summers,—she found ample scope for admiration and delight. <seg xml:id="C07d_app26-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C07d_app39-f1831_start"/>While my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their causes. <seg xml:id="C07d_app39-f1831_end"/>The world was to me a <seg xml:id="C07d_app49-f1831_start"/>secret <seg xml:id="C07d_app49-f1831_end"/>which I desired to <seg xml:id="C07d_app51-f1831_start"/>divine.

We possessed a house in Geneva, and a campagne on Belrive, the eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a league from the city. We resided principally in the latter, and the lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion. It was my temper to avoid a crowd, and to attach myself fervently to a few. <seg xml:id="C07d_app58-f1831_end"/>
