On this occasion a man of great research in natural philosophy was with us, and, excited by this catastrophe, he entered on the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me. All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa, Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies. It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever be known. All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew despicable. By one of those caprices of the mind, which we are perhaps most subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my former occupations; set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed and abortive creation; and entertained the greatest disdain for a would-be science, which could never even step within the threshold of real knowledge. In this mood of mind I betook myself to the mathematics, and the branches of study appertaining to that science, as being built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration.&lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p14"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p15"/&gt;Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments are we bound to prosperity or ruin. When I look back, it seems to me as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my lifeâ€” the last effort made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even then hanging in the stars, and ready to envelope me. Her victory was announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul, which followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting studies. It was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil with their prosecution, happiness with their disregard.&lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p15"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p16"/&gt; &lt;pb xml:id="F1831_v_045" n="29"/&gt;It was a strong effort of the spirit of good; but it was ineffectual. Destiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and terrible destruction.&lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p16"/&gt; &lt;milestone unit="chapter" type="end" n="2"/&gt;<seg xml:id="C07h_app1-f1831_end"/>
