I expressed these feelings in my answer.&lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p34"/&gt;&lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p35"/&gt;“I thank you,” he replied, “for &lt;pb n="37" xml:id="F1823_v1_056"/&gt;your sympathy, but it is useless; my fate is nearly fulfilled. I wait but for one event, and then I shall repose in peace.
