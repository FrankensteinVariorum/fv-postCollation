I shall not be supposed as according the remotest degree of serious faith to such an imagination; yet, in assuming it as the basis of a work of fancy, I have not considered myself as merely &lt;pb xml:id="F1823_v1_013" n="vi"/&gt;weaving a series of supernatural terrors. The event on which the interest of the story depends is exempt from the disadvantages of a mere tale of spectres or enchantment. It was recommended by the novelty of the situations which it developes; and, however impossible as a physical fact, affords a point of view to the imagination for the delineating of human passions more comprehensive and commanding than any which the ordinary relations of existing events can yield. &lt;p eID="preface1_p1"/&gt; &lt;p sID="preface1_p2"/&gt; I have thus endeavoured to preserve the truth of the elementary &lt;pb xml:id="F1823_v1_014" n="vii"/&gt;principles of human nature, while I have not scrupled to innovate upon their combinations.

            <seg xml:id="C01_app15-f1823_start"/>partly as a source of amusement, and partly as an expedient for exercising any untried resources of mind. Other motives were mingled with these, as the work proceeded. I am by no means indifferent to the manner in which whatever moral tendencies exist in the sentiments or characters it contains shall affect the reader; yet my chief concern in this respect has been limited to the avoiding the enervating effects of the novels of the present day, and to the exhibition &lt;pb xml:id="F1823_v1_016" n="ix"/&gt;of the amiableness of domestic affection, and the excellence of universal virtue. The opinions which naturally spring from the character and situation of the hero are by no means to be conceived as existing always in my own conviction; nor is any inference justly to be drawn from the following pages as prejudicing any philosophical doctrine of whatever kind. &lt;p eID="preface1_p3"/&gt; &lt;p sID="preface1_p4"/&gt; It is a subject also of additional interest to the author, that this story was begun in the majestic region where the scene is principally laid, and in society which cannot cease to &lt;pb xml:id="F1823_v1_017" n="x"/&gt;be regretted. I passed the summer of 1816 in the environs of Geneva. The season was cold and rainy, and in the evenings we crowded around a blazing wood fire, and occasionally amused ourselves with some German stories of ghosts, which happened to fall into our hands. These tales excited in us a playful desire of imitation. Two other friends (a tale from the pen of one of whom would be far more acceptable to the public than any thing I can ever hope to produce) and myself agreed to write each a story, founded on some supernatural occurrence. &lt;p eID="preface1_p4"/&gt; &lt;p sID="preface1_p5"/&gt; &lt;pb xml:id="F1823_v1_018" n="xi"/&gt;The weather, however, suddenly became serene; and my two friends left me on a journey among the Alps, and lost, in the magnificent scenes which they present, all memory of their ghostly visions. The following tale is the only one which has been completed.<seg xml:id="C01_app15-f1823_end"/>
