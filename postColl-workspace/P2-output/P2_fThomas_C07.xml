One of his most intimate friends was a merchant, who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a proud and unbending disposition, and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts, therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in wretchedness. My father loved Beau&lt;pb xml:id="F1818_v1_053" n="041"/&gt;fort with the truest friendship, and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances. He

        &lt;seg sID="C07_app17-fThomas"/&gt;
        to seek him

        him to begin the world again through his credit and assistance. &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p2"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p3"/&gt; Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself; and it was ten months before my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery, he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street, near the Reuss. But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes; but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in the mean time he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a mer&lt;pb xml:id="F1818_v1_054" n="042"/&gt;chant’s house. The interval
        &lt;seg eID="C07_app20-fThomas"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C07_app21-fThomas"/&gt;
        was consequently
        &lt;seg eID="C07_app21-fThomas"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C07_app22-fThomas"/&gt;
        spent in inaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling, when he had leisure for reflection; and at length it took so fast hold of his mind, that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion. &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p3"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p4"/&gt; His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness; but she saw with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing, and that there was no other prospect of support. But Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould; and her courage rose to support her in her adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw; and by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life. &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p4"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p5"/&gt; Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time &lt;pb xml:id="F1818_v1_055" n="043"/&gt;was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving her an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her; and she knelt by Beaufort’s coffin, weeping bitterly, when my father entered the chamber. He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who committed herself to his

        he conducted her to Geneva, and placed her under the protection of a relation. Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.

        &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p6"/&gt; &lt;del rend="strikethrough"&gt;When my father became a husband and a parent, he found his time so occupied by the duties of his new situation, that he&lt;/del&gt; &lt;add&gt;As my father’s age encreased he became more attached to the quiet of a domestic life, and he gradually&lt;/add&gt; relinquished &lt;del rend="strikethrough"&gt;many of&lt;/del&gt; his public employments, and devoted himself &lt;add place="margin"&gt;with ardour &lt;/add&gt;to the education of his children.
        &lt;seg eID="C07_app28-fThomas"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C07_app29-fThomas"/&gt;
        Of these I was the eldest, and the destined suc&lt;pb xml:id="F1818_v1_056" n="044"/&gt;cessor to all his labours and utility. No creature could have more tender parents than mine. My improvement and health were their constant care, especially as I remained for several years their only child. But before I continue my narrative, I must record an incident which took place when I was four years of age. &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p6"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p7"/&gt; My father had a sister, whom he tenderly loved, and who had married early in life an Italian gentleman. Soon after her marriage, she had accompanied her husband
        &lt;seg eID="C07_app29-fThomas"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C07_app30-fThomas"/&gt;
        into &lt;del&gt;her&lt;/del&gt; &lt;add&gt;his&lt;/add&gt; native country,
        &lt;seg eID="C07_app30-fThomas"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C07_app31-fThomas"/&gt;
        and for some years my father had very little communication with her. About the time I mentioned she died; and a few months afterwards he received a letter from her husband, acquainting him with his intention of marrying an Italian lady, and requesting my father to take charge of the in&lt;pb xml:id="F1818_v1_057" n="045"/&gt;fant Elizabeth, the only child of his deceased sister. “It is my wish,” he said, “that you should consider her as your own daughter, and educate her thus. Her
        &lt;seg eID="C07_app31-fThomas"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C07_app32-fThomas"/&gt;
        mother’s
        &lt;seg eID="C07_app32-fThomas"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C07_app33-fThomas"/&gt;
        fortune is secured to her, the documents of which I will commit to your keeping. Reflect upon this proposition; and decide whether you would prefer educating your niece yourself to her being brought up by a stepmother.” &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p7"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p8"/&gt; My father did not hesitate, and immediately went to Italy, that he might accompany the little Elizabeth to her future home. I have often heard my mother say, that she was at that time the most beautiful child she had ever seen, and
        &lt;seg eID="C07_app33-fThomas"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C07_app34-fThomas"/&gt;
        shewed
        &lt;seg eID="C07_app34-fThomas"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C07_app35-fThomas"/&gt;
        &lt;add&gt;every &lt;/add&gt; sign &lt;del&gt;s even then&lt;/del&gt;
        &lt;seg eID="C07_app35-fThomas"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C07_app36-fThomas"/&gt;
        of a gentle and affectionate disposition. These indications, and a desire to bind as closely as possible the ties of domestic love, determined my mother to consider &lt;pb xml:id="F1818_v1_058" n="046"/&gt;Elizabeth as my future wife; a design which she never found reason to repent.
        &lt;seg eID="C07_app36-fThomas"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C07_app37-fThomas"/&gt;

        &lt;seg eID="C07_app37-fThomas"/&gt;

        &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p9"/&gt; From this time Elizabeth Lavenza became my playfellow, and, as we grew older, my friend. She was docile and good tempered, yet gay and playful as a summer insect. Although she was lively and animated, her feelings were strong and deep, and her disposition uncommonly affectionate. No one could better enjoy liberty, yet no one could submit with more grace than she did to constraint and caprice. Her imagination was luxuriant, yet her capability of application was great. Her person was the image of her mind; her hazel eyes, although as lively as a bird’s, possessed an attractive softness. Her figure was light and airy; and, though capable of enduring great fatigue, she appeared the most fragile creature in the world. While I admired &lt;pb xml:id="F1818_v1_059" n="047"/&gt;her understanding and fancy, I loved to tend on her, as I should on a favourite animal; and I never saw so much grace both of person and mind united to so little pretension. &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p9"/&gt;
