        &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p11"/&gt;Every one loved Elizabeth. The passionate and almost reverential attachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it, my pride and my delight. On the evening previous to her being brought to my home, my mother had said playfully,—“I have a pretty present for my Victor—to-morrow he shall have it.” And when, on the morrow, she presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish seriousness, interpreted her words literally, and looked upon Elizabeth as mine—mine to protect, love, and &lt;pb xml:id="F1831_v_039" n="23"/&gt;cherish. All praises bestowed on her, I received as made to a possession of my own. We called each other familiarly by the name of cousin. No word, no expression could body forth the kind of relation in which she stood to me—my more than sister, since till death she was to be mine only.&lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p11"/&gt; &lt;milestone unit="chapter" type="end" n="1"/&gt; &lt;milestone unit="chapter" type="start" n="2"/&gt; &lt;head&gt;CHAPTER II.&lt;/head&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p1"/&gt; W&lt;hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p1_hi1"/&gt;E&lt;hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p1_hi1"/&gt; were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in our ages. I need not say that we were strangers to any species of disunion or dispute. Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer together. Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense application, and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge. She busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets; and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss home—the sublime shapes of the mountains; the changes of the seasons; tempest and calm; the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of our Alpine summers,—she found ample scope for admiration and delight. tigating their While my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent appearances of things, I delighted in inves causes. The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine. Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature, gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the earliest sensations I can remember.&lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p1"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p2"/&gt;On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave up entirely their wandering life, and fixed themselves in their native country. We possessed a house in Geneva, and a &lt;hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p2_hi1"/&gt;campagne&lt;hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p2_hi1"/&gt; on Belrive, the eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a league from the city. We resided principally in the latter, and &lt;pb xml:id="F1831_v_040" n="24"/&gt;the lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion. It was my temper to avoid a crowd, and to attach myself fervently to a few. I was indifferent, therefore, to my schoolfellows in general; but I united myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them.

        Clerval
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app48-f1831_end"/&gt;
    was the son  
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app50-f1831_start"/&gt;
        of a merchant of Geneva.
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app50-f1831_end"/&gt;
    He was a boy of singular talent and 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app52-f1831_start"/&gt;
        fancy. He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger, for its own sake. He was deeply read
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app52-f1831_end"/&gt;
    in books of  
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app57-f1831_start"/&gt;
        chivalry and romance. He composed heroic songs, and began to write many a tale of enchantment and knightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays, and to enter into masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of Roncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels.
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app57-f1831_end"/&gt;

        No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. My parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence. We felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights which we enjoyed. When I mingled with other families, I distinctly discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted the developement of filial love.
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app59-f1831_end"/&gt;

        &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p4"/&gt;My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some law in my temperature they were turned, not towards childish pursuits, but to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things indiscriminately. I confess that neither the structure of languages, nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states, possessed attractions for me. It was the secrets of heaven and earth that I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of things, or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me, still my enquiries were directed to the metaphysical, or, in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.&lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p4"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p5"/&gt;Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral relations of things. The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes, and the actions of men, were his theme; and his hope and his dream was to become one among those &lt;pb xml:id="F1831_v_041" n="25"/&gt;whose names are recorded in story, as the gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species. The saintly soul of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home. Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of her celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us. She was the living spirit of love to soften and attract: I might have become sullen in my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness. And Clerval—could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval?—yet he might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his generosity—so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of beneficence, and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring ambition.&lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p5"/&gt;

        exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood, before misfortune had tainted my mind, and changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self.

        to my after tale of misery: for when I would account to myself for the birth of that passion, which afterwards ruled my destiny, I find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost forgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent which, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys. &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p6"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p7"/&gt;

        predilection
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app89-f1831_end"/&gt;
    for that science. When I was

        thirteen
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app92-f1831_end"/&gt;

        of age,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app94-f1831_end"/&gt;
    we all went on a party of pleasure to 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app96-f1831_start"/&gt;
        the baths near Thonon: the
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app96-f1831_end"/&gt;
    inclemency of the weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In this house I chanced to 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app98-f1831_start"/&gt;
        find
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app98-f1831_end"/&gt;
    a

        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app101-f1831_start"/&gt;

    soon changed this feeling into

        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app156-f1831_end"/&gt;
    I should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside, 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app158-f1831_start"/&gt;
        and
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app158-f1831_end"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app159-f1831_start"/&gt;

    my 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app161-f1831_start"/&gt;
        imagination,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app161-f1831_end"/&gt;
    warmed as it 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app163-f1831_start"/&gt;
        was, by returning with greater ardour to my former studies.
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app163-f1831_end"/&gt;
    It is even 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app165-f1831_start"/&gt;
        possible,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app165-f1831_end"/&gt;
    that the train of my ideas 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app167-f1831_start"/&gt;
        would
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app167-f1831_end"/&gt;
    never have 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app169-f1831_start"/&gt;
        received the
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app169-f1831_end"/&gt;
    fatal impulse 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app171-f1831_start"/&gt;
        that
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app171-f1831_end"/&gt;
    led 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app173-f1831_start"/&gt;
        to my ruin.
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app173-f1831_end"/&gt;
    But the cursory glance my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was acquainted with  
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app175-f1831_start"/&gt;
        its
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app175-f1831_end"/&gt;
    contents; and I continued to read with the  
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app177-f1831_start"/&gt;
        greatest
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app177-f1831_end"/&gt;

        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app179-f1831_start"/&gt;
        When I returned home, my first care was to procure
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app179-f1831_end"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app180-f1831_start"/&gt;
        the

        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app181-f1831_start"/&gt;
        whole
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app181-f1831_end"/&gt;
    works of this 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app183-f1831_start"/&gt;
        author,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app183-f1831_end"/&gt;
    and afterwards 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app185-f1831_start"/&gt;
        of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. I read and studied the wild fancies of
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app185-f1831_end"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app186-f1831_start"/&gt;
        these writers
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app186-f1831_end"/&gt;
    with 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app188-f1831_start"/&gt;
        delight;
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app188-f1831_end"/&gt;
    they appeared to me treasures known to few 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app190-f1831_start"/&gt;
        beside myself. I have described myself as always having been embued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of nature. In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern philosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied. Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth. Those of his successors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted, appeared even to my boy’s apprehensions, as tyros engaged in the same pursuit.&lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p9"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p10"/&gt;The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him, and was acquainted with their practical uses. The most learned philosopher knew little more. He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery. He might dissect, anatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes in their secondary and tertiary grades were &lt;pb xml:id="F1831_v_043" n="27"/&gt;utterly unknown to him. I had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and ignorantly I had repined.&lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p10"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p11"/&gt;But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew more. I took their word for all that they averred, and I became their disciple.
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app190-f1831_end"/&gt;
    It may appear 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app205-f1831_start"/&gt;
        strange that such
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app205-f1831_end"/&gt;
    should arise in the eighteenth 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app210-f1831_start"/&gt;
        century;
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app210-f1831_end"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app211-f1831_start"/&gt;
        but while I followed the routine of education in the schools of Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self taught with regard to my favourite studies. My father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with a child’s blindness, added to a student’s thirst for knowledge. Under the guidance of my new preceptors,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app211-f1831_end"/&gt;
    I entered with the 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app219-f1831_start"/&gt;
        greatest
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app219-f1831_end"/&gt;
    diligence into the search of the  
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app222-f1831_start"/&gt;
        philosopher’s
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app222-f1831_end"/&gt;
    stone and the 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app224-f1831_start"/&gt;
        elixir
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app224-f1831_end"/&gt;
    of 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app226-f1831_start"/&gt;
        life;
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app226-f1831_end"/&gt;
    but the latter 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app228-f1831_start"/&gt;
        soon obtained my

        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app229-f1831_start"/&gt;
        undivided attention.
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app229-f1831_end"/&gt;
    Wealth was an inferior

        object;
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app231-f1831_end"/&gt;
    but what

        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app234-f1831_start"/&gt;
        would attend

    the 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app236-f1831_start"/&gt;
        discovery,

    if I could

        banish disease from the human

    a violent

        death!

        visions.
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app249-f1831_end"/&gt;
    The raising of ghosts or devils 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app251-f1831_start"/&gt;
        was a promise liberally accorded by
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app251-f1831_end"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app252-f1831_start"/&gt;

        authors,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app253-f1831_end"/&gt;
    the fulfilment of which I most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app255-f1831_start"/&gt;
        unsuccessful, I
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app255-f1831_end"/&gt;
    attributed 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app257-f1831_start"/&gt;
        the failure
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app257-f1831_end"/&gt;
    rather to my own inexperience  
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app259-f1831_start"/&gt;
        and mistake, than to a want of skill or fidelity
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app259-f1831_end"/&gt;
    in my 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app261-f1831_start"/&gt;
        instructors.

        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app262-f1831_start"/&gt;
        And thus for a time I was occupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousand contradictory theories, and floundering desperately in a very slough of multifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and childish reasoning, till an accident again changed the current of my ideas.

    when we witnessed

        a most violent and terrible thunder-storm.

        Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electricity. On this occasion a man of great research in natural philosophy was with us, and, excited by this catastrophe, he entered on the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me. All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa, Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies. It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever be known. All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew despicable. By one of those caprices of the mind, which we are perhaps most subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my former occupations; set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed and abortive creation; and entertained the greatest disdain for a would-be science, which could never even step within the threshold of real knowledge. In this mood of mind I betook myself to the mathematics, and the branches of study appertaining to that science, as being built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration.

        Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments are we bound to prosperity or ruin. When I look back, it seems to me as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life— the last effort made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even then hanging in the stars, and ready to envelope me. Her victory was announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul, which followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting studies. It was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil with their prosecution, happiness with their disregard.&lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p15"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p16"/&gt; &lt;pb xml:id="F1831_v_045" n="29"/&gt;It was a strong effort of the spirit of good; but it was ineffectual. Destiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and terrible destruction.

        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app489-f1831_end"/&gt;
    resolved that I should  
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app491-f1831_start"/&gt;
        become a student at the university of Ingolstadt.
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app491-f1831_end"/&gt;

        necessary,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app495-f1831_end"/&gt;
    for the completion of my

        education,

        than those of my native country. My departure was therefore fixed

    Elizabeth had caught the scarlet

        fever; her illness was severe, and she was in the greatest danger.
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app512-f1831_end"/&gt;
    During her 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app514-f1831_start"/&gt;
        illness,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app514-f1831_end"/&gt;
    many arguments had been urged to persuade my mother 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app516-f1831_start"/&gt;
        to refrain from
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app516-f1831_end"/&gt;

    upon her. She 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app519-f1831_start"/&gt;
        had, at first, yielded
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app519-f1831_end"/&gt;
    to our

        heard that

        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app524-f1831_start"/&gt;
        the life of her favourite was

        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app525-f1831_start"/&gt;

    she

        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app528-f1831_start"/&gt;
        control her anxiety. She attended her sick bed,—her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity of the distemper,—Elizabeth was saved, but
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app528-f1831_end"/&gt;
    the consequences of this imprudence were

        fatal to her preserver.
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app530-f1831_end"/&gt;

        myself:—“My children,” she said, “my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect of your union. This expectation will now be the consolation of your father.

    and dear to the

        ear,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app600-f1831_end"/&gt;
    can be hushed, never more to be heard. These are the reflections of the first 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app602-f1831_start"/&gt;
        days;
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app602-f1831_end"/&gt;
    but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app604-f1831_start"/&gt;
        evil,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app604-f1831_end"/&gt;
    then the

        actual
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app606-f1831_end"/&gt;
    bitterness of grief 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app608-f1831_start"/&gt;
        commences. Yet

    from whom

        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app612-f1831_end"/&gt;

        should

    time at length 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app618-f1831_start"/&gt;
        arrives,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app618-f1831_end"/&gt;
    when grief is rather an indulgence 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app620-f1831_start"/&gt;
        than a

        upon
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app623-f1831_end"/&gt;
    the lips, although it

        may be

    deemed 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app627-f1831_start"/&gt;
        a sacrilege, is not banished.

    My mother

        dead,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app630-f1831_end"/&gt;
    but we had still duties which we ought to

        perform;
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app632-f1831_end"/&gt;
    we must continue our course with the

        rest,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app634-f1831_end"/&gt;
    and learn to think

        ourselves fortunate,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app636-f1831_end"/&gt;
    whilst one remains whom the spoiler has not seized. &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p3"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p4"/&gt; My  
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app639-f1831_start"/&gt;
        departure for
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app639-f1831_end"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app640-f1831_start"/&gt;
        Ingolstadt,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app640-f1831_end"/&gt;
    which had been deferred by these 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app642-f1831_start"/&gt;
        events,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app642-f1831_end"/&gt;
    was now again determined 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app644-f1831_start"/&gt;
        upon.
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app644-f1831_end"/&gt;
    I 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app646-f1831_start"/&gt;
        obtained from my father a respite of some weeks. It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose, akin to death, of the house of mourning, and to rush into the thick of life. I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me. I was unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me; and, above all, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled. &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p4"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p5"/&gt; She indeed veiled her grief, and strove to act the comforter to us all. She looked steadily on life, and assumed its duties with courage and zeal. She devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call her uncle and &lt;pb xml:id="F1831_v_047" n="31"/&gt;cousins.
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app646-f1831_end"/&gt;
    Never 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app681-f1831_start"/&gt;
        was she so enchanting as at this time, when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us. She forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget.
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app681-f1831_end"/&gt;
    &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p5"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p6"/&gt; The day of my departure at 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app683-f1831_start"/&gt;
        length arrived.
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app683-f1831_end"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app684-f1831_start"/&gt;
        Clerval spent the last evening with us. He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit him to accompany me, and to become my fellow student; but in vain. His father was a narrow-minded trader, and saw idleness and ruin in the aspirations and ambition of his son.
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app684-f1831_end"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app699-f1831_start"/&gt;
        Henry
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app699-f1831_end"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app700-f1831_start"/&gt;
        deeply felt the misfortune of being debarred from a liberal education. He said little; but when he spoke, I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a restrained but firm resolve, not to be chained to the miserable details of commerce.
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app700-f1831_end"/&gt;
    &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p6"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p7"/&gt; We 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app702-f1831_start"/&gt;
        sat late. We could not tear ourselves away from each other, nor persuade ourselves to say the word “Farewell!” It was said; and we retired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the other was deceived: but when at morning’s dawn I descended to the carriage which was to convey me away, they were all there—my father again to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to renew her entreaties that I would write often, and to bestow the last feminine attentions on her playmate and friend.
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app702-f1831_end"/&gt;
    &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p7"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p8"/&gt; I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app715-f1831_start"/&gt;
        away,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app715-f1831_end"/&gt;
    and indulged in the most melancholy reflections. 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app717-f1831_start"/&gt;
        I,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app717-f1831_end"/&gt;
    who had ever been surrounded by amiable companions, continually engaged in 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app719-f1831_start"/&gt;
        endeavouring to
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app719-f1831_end"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app720-f1831_start"/&gt;
        bestow
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app720-f1831_end"/&gt;
    mutual 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app722-f1831_start"/&gt;
        pleasure,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app722-f1831_end"/&gt;
    I was now alone. 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app724-f1831_start"/&gt;
        In the university,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app724-f1831_end"/&gt;
    whither I was 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app726-f1831_start"/&gt;
        going,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app726-f1831_end"/&gt;
    I must form my own 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app728-f1831_start"/&gt;
        friends,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app728-f1831_end"/&gt;
    and be my own 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app730-f1831_start"/&gt;
        protector.
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app730-f1831_end"/&gt;
    My life had hitherto been remarkably  
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app732-f1831_start"/&gt;
        secluded
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app732-f1831_end"/&gt;
    and 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app734-f1831_start"/&gt;
        domestic;
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app734-f1831_end"/&gt;
    and this had given me 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app736-f1831_start"/&gt;
        invincible repugnance to new
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app736-f1831_end"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app737-f1831_start"/&gt;
        countenances. I loved my
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app737-f1831_end"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app738-f1831_start"/&gt;
        brothers, Elizabeth,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app738-f1831_end"/&gt;
    and 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app740-f1831_start"/&gt;
        Clerval;
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app740-f1831_end"/&gt;
    these were “old familiar 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app742-f1831_start"/&gt;
        faces;”
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app742-f1831_end"/&gt;
    but I believed myself totally unfitted for the company of strangers. Such were my reflections as I commenced my 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app744-f1831_start"/&gt;
        journey;
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app744-f1831_end"/&gt;
    but as I 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app746-f1831_start"/&gt;
        proceeded,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app746-f1831_end"/&gt;
    my spirits and hopes rose. I ardently desired 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app748-f1831_start"/&gt;
        the acquisition of knowledge.
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app748-f1831_end"/&gt;
    I had 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app750-f1831_start"/&gt;
        often,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app750-f1831_end"/&gt;
    when at 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app752-f1831_start"/&gt;
        home,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app752-f1831_end"/&gt;
    thought 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app754-f1831_start"/&gt;
        it
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app754-f1831_end"/&gt;
    hard  
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app756-f1831_start"/&gt;
        to remain during my youth
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app756-f1831_end"/&gt;
    cooped up in one  
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app758-f1831_start"/&gt;
        place,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app758-f1831_end"/&gt;
    and had longed to enter  
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app761-f1831_start"/&gt;
        the
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app761-f1831_end"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app762-f1831_start"/&gt;
        world,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app762-f1831_end"/&gt;
    and take my

        &lt;pb xml:id="F1831_v_048" n="32"/&gt;station among

    other human beings.  
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app766-f1831_start"/&gt;
        Now my desires were
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app766-f1831_end"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app767-f1831_start"/&gt;
        complied with,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app767-f1831_end"/&gt;
    and it 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app769-f1831_start"/&gt;
        would, indeed,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app769-f1831_end"/&gt;
    have 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app771-f1831_start"/&gt;
        been folly to repent. &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p8"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p9"/&gt; I had
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app771-f1831_end"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app772-f1831_start"/&gt;
        sufficient
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app772-f1831_end"/&gt;
    leisure for these and many other reflections during my journey to  
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app774-f1831_start"/&gt;
        Ingolstadt,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app774-f1831_end"/&gt;
    which was long and 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app776-f1831_start"/&gt;
        fatiguing.
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app776-f1831_end"/&gt;
    At length the 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app778-f1831_start"/&gt;
        high white steeple
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app778-f1831_end"/&gt;
    of the town met my eyes. I 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app780-f1831_start"/&gt;
        alighted,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app780-f1831_end"/&gt;
    and was conducted to my solitary 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app782-f1831_start"/&gt;
        apartment,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app782-f1831_end"/&gt;
    to spend the evening as I pleased.

        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app784-f1831_end"/&gt;
    and paid a visit to some of the principal

        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app788-f1831_start"/&gt;

    professor of

        natural philosophy. He

        was an uncouth man, but deeply embued in the secrets of his science. He
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app791-f1831_end"/&gt;
    asked me several questions concerning my progress in the 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app793-f1831_start"/&gt;
        different branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy.

        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app794-f1831_start"/&gt;
        I replied carelessly; and, partly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchymists as the principal authors I had studied.

    The professor 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app796-f1831_start"/&gt;
        stared: “Have you,” he said, “really spent your

        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app798-f1831_end"/&gt;

        reprobated; but I returned, not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any shape.

    was a little squat

        man,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app895-f1831_end"/&gt;

        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app900-f1831_end"/&gt;
    did not prepossess me in favour of his 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app902-f1831_start"/&gt;
        pursuits. In rather a too philosophical and connected a strain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come to concerning them in my early years. As a child, I had not been content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural science. With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my extreme youth, and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the steps of knowledge along the paths of time, and exchanged the discoveries of recent enquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchymists.
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app902-f1831_end"/&gt;

        natural
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app905-f1831_end"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app906-f1831_start"/&gt;
        philosophy.
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app906-f1831_end"/&gt;
    It was very 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app908-f1831_start"/&gt;
        different,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app908-f1831_end"/&gt;
    when the 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app910-f1831_start"/&gt;
        masters of the science sought immortality and
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app910-f1831_end"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app911-f1831_start"/&gt;

        futile,

        grand:

        changed.

    The

        ambition of the enquirer
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app923-f1831_end"/&gt;
    seemed to limit itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in science was chiefly founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of boundless 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app925-f1831_start"/&gt;
        grandeur
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app925-f1831_end"/&gt;

        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app928-f1831_start"/&gt;
        the first two or three days of my residence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming acquainted with the localities, and the principal residents in my new abode.

    had given me concerning the

        lectures.
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app937-f1831_end"/&gt;
    And although I could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentences 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app939-f1831_start"/&gt;
        out of a pulpit,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app939-f1831_end"/&gt;
    I recollected what he had said of 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app941-f1831_start"/&gt;
        M. Waldman,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app941-f1831_end"/&gt;
    whom I had never 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app943-f1831_start"/&gt;
        seen,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app943-f1831_end"/&gt;
    as he had 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app945-f1831_start"/&gt;
        hitherto been
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app945-f1831_end"/&gt;
    out of town. &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p14"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p15"/&gt; 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app947-f1831_start"/&gt;
        Partly from
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app947-f1831_end"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app948-f1831_start"/&gt;
        curiosity,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app948-f1831_end"/&gt;
    and partly from 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app950-f1831_start"/&gt;
        idleness,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app950-f1831_end"/&gt;
    I went into the lecturing 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app952-f1831_start"/&gt;
        room,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app952-f1831_end"/&gt;
    which 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app954-f1831_start"/&gt;
        M. Waldman
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app954-f1831_end"/&gt;
    entered shortly after. This professor was 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app956-f1831_start"/&gt;
        very
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app956-f1831_end"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app957-f1831_start"/&gt;
        unlike
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app957-f1831_end"/&gt;
    his colleague. He 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app959-f1831_start"/&gt;
        appeared about fifty years of age, but with an aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence;
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app959-f1831_end"/&gt;
    a few 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app961-f1831_start"/&gt;
        grey
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app961-f1831_end"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app962-f1831_start"/&gt;
        hairs covered his
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app962-f1831_end"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app963-f1831_start"/&gt;
        temples,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app963-f1831_end"/&gt;
    but those at the back of his head were &lt;pb xml:id="F1831_v_050" n="34"/&gt;nearly black. 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app965-f1831_start"/&gt;
        His person
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app965-f1831_end"/&gt;
    was 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app967-f1831_start"/&gt;
        short,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app967-f1831_end"/&gt;
    but remarkably 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app969-f1831_start"/&gt;
        erect;
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app969-f1831_end"/&gt;
    and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard. He began his lecture 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app971-f1831_start"/&gt;
        by a recapitulation of the
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app971-f1831_end"/&gt;
    history of  
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app973-f1831_start"/&gt;
        chemistry,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app973-f1831_end"/&gt;
    and 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app975-f1831_start"/&gt;
        the various improvements
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app975-f1831_end"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app976-f1831_start"/&gt;
        made
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app976-f1831_end"/&gt;
    by 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app978-f1831_start"/&gt;
        different
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app978-f1831_end"/&gt;
    men 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app980-f1831_start"/&gt;
        of
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app980-f1831_end"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app981-f1831_start"/&gt;
        learning, pronouncing with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers.
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app981-f1831_end"/&gt;
    He then took a cursory view of the present state of 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app983-f1831_start"/&gt;
        the science,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app983-f1831_end"/&gt;
    and explained many of its  
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app985-f1831_start"/&gt;
        elementary
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app985-f1831_end"/&gt;
    terms. 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app987-f1831_start"/&gt;
        After
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app987-f1831_end"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app988-f1831_start"/&gt;
        having made
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app988-f1831_end"/&gt;
    a few preparatory 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app990-f1831_start"/&gt;
        experiments,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app990-f1831_end"/&gt;
    he concluded with a panegyric upon 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app992-f1831_start"/&gt;
        modern chemistry,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app992-f1831_end"/&gt;
    the 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app994-f1831_start"/&gt;
        terms
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app994-f1831_end"/&gt;
    of which I shall never 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app996-f1831_start"/&gt;
        forget:—
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app996-f1831_end"/&gt;
    &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p15"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p16"/&gt; “The ancient teachers of this

        science,”
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app998-f1831_end"/&gt;
    said he, “promised 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app1000-f1831_start"/&gt;
        impossibilities, and
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app1000-f1831_end"/&gt;
    performed nothing. The modern

        masters
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app1002-f1831_end"/&gt;
    promise very

        transmuted,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app1007-f1831_end"/&gt;
    and that the elixir 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app1009-f1831_start"/&gt;
        of life
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app1009-f1831_end"/&gt;
    is a

        chimera.
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app1011-f1831_end"/&gt;
    But 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app1013-f1831_start"/&gt;
        these philosophers,

        dirt,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app1018-f1831_end"/&gt;
    and their eyes to

    new and almost unlimited

        Such were the professor’s words—rather let me say such the words of fate, enounced to destroy me. As he went on, I felt as if my soul were grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were touched which formed the mechanism of my being: chord after chord was sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception, one purpose. So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of Frankenstein,—more, far more, will I achieve: treading in the steps already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.&lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p17"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p18"/&gt;I closed not my eyes that night. My internal being was in a state of insurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I had no power to produce it. By degrees, after the morning’s dawn, sleep came. I awoke, and my yesternight’s thoughts were as a dream. There only &lt;pb xml:id="F1831_v_051" n="35"/&gt;remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies, and to devote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a natural talent. On the same day, I paid M. Waldman a visit.
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app1057-f1831_end"/&gt;
    His manners in private were even more mild 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app1059-f1831_start"/&gt;
        and attractive than in public;
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app1059-f1831_end"/&gt;
    for there was a certain dignity in his 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app1061-f1831_start"/&gt;
        mien
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app1061-f1831_end"/&gt;
    during his 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app1063-f1831_start"/&gt;
        lecture, which in his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness.
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app1063-f1831_end"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app1064-f1831_start"/&gt;
        I gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had given to his fellow-professor. He heard
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app1064-f1831_end"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app1065-f1831_start"/&gt;
        with attention the little narration concerning my studies, and
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app1065-f1831_end"/&gt;
    smiled at the names of Cornelius 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app1067-f1831_start"/&gt;
        Agrippa
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app1067-f1831_end"/&gt;
    and 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app1069-f1831_start"/&gt;
        Paracelsus,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app1069-f1831_end"/&gt;
    but without the contempt that

        M.
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app1071-f1831_end"/&gt;
    Krempe had 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app1073-f1831_start"/&gt;
        exhibited.
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app1073-f1831_end"/&gt;
    He 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app1075-f1831_start"/&gt;
        said,
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app1075-f1831_end"/&gt;
    that

        “these
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app1077-f1831_end"/&gt;
    were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern 
        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app1079-f1831_start"/&gt;
        philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their

        &lt;seg xml:id="C08_app1080-f1831_start"/&gt;

        added,
