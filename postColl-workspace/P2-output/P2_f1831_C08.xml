        &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p11"/&gt;Every one loved Elizabeth. The passionate and almost reverential attachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it, my pride and my delight. On the evening previous to her being brought to my home, my mother had said playfully,—“I have a pretty present for my Victor—to-morrow he shall have it.” And when, on the morrow, she presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish seriousness, interpreted her words literally, and looked upon Elizabeth as mine—mine to protect, love, and &lt;pb xml:id="F1831_v_039" n="23"/&gt;cherish. All praises bestowed on her, I received as made to a possession of my own. We called each other familiarly by the name of cousin. No word, no expression could body forth the kind of relation in which she stood to me—my more than sister, since till death she was to be mine only.&lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p11"/&gt; &lt;milestone unit="chapter" type="end" n="1"/&gt; &lt;milestone unit="chapter" type="start" n="2"/&gt; &lt;head&gt;CHAPTER II.&lt;/head&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p1"/&gt; W&lt;hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p1_hi1"/&gt;E&lt;hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p1_hi1"/&gt; were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in our ages. I need not say that we were strangers to any species of disunion or dispute. Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer together. Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense application, and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge. She busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets; and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss home—the sublime shapes of the mountains; the changes of the seasons; tempest and calm; the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of our Alpine summers,—she found ample scope for admiration and delight. tigating their While my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent appearances of things, I delighted in inves causes. The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine. Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature, gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the earliest sensations I can remember.&lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p1"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p2"/&gt;On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave up entirely their wandering life, and fixed themselves in their native country. We possessed a house in Geneva, and a &lt;hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p2_hi1"/&gt;campagne&lt;hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p2_hi1"/&gt; on Belrive, the eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a league from the city. We resided principally in the latter, and &lt;pb xml:id="F1831_v_040" n="24"/&gt;the lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion. It was my temper to avoid a crowd, and to attach myself fervently to a few. I was indifferent, therefore, to my schoolfellows in general; but I united myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them.

        Clerval
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app48-f1831"/&gt;
    was the son  
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app50-f1831"/&gt;
        of a merchant of Geneva.
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app50-f1831"/&gt;
    He was a boy of singular talent and 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app52-f1831"/&gt;
        fancy. He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger, for its own sake. He was deeply read
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app52-f1831"/&gt;
    in books of  
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app57-f1831"/&gt;
        chivalry and romance. He composed heroic songs, and began to write many a tale of enchantment and knightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays, and to enter into masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of Roncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels.
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app57-f1831"/&gt;

        No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. My parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence. We felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights which we enjoyed. When I mingled with other families, I distinctly discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted the developement of filial love.
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app59-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app60-f1831"/&gt;

        &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p4"/&gt;My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some law in my temperature they were turned, not towards childish pursuits, but to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things indiscriminately. I confess that neither the structure of languages, nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states, possessed attractions for me. It was the secrets of heaven and earth that I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of things, or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me, still my enquiries were directed to the metaphysical, or, in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.&lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p4"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p5"/&gt;Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral relations of things. The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes, and the actions of men, were his theme; and his hope and his dream was to become one among those &lt;pb xml:id="F1831_v_041" n="25"/&gt;whose names are recorded in story, as the gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species. The saintly soul of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home. Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of her celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us. She was the living spirit of love to soften and attract: I might have become sullen in my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness. And Clerval—could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval?—yet he might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his generosity—so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of beneficence, and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring ambition.&lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p5"/&gt;

        I feel
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app78-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app79-f1831"/&gt;
        exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood, before misfortune had tainted my mind, and changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self.

        &lt;seg sID="C08_app85-f1831"/&gt;
        to my after tale of misery: for when I would account to myself for the birth of that passion, which afterwards ruled my destiny, I find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost forgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent which, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys. &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p6"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p7"/&gt;

    those facts which led to my

        predilection
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app94-f1831"/&gt;
    for that science. When I was  
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app97-f1831"/&gt;
        thirteen
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app97-f1831"/&gt;
    years 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app99-f1831"/&gt;
        of age,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app99-f1831"/&gt;
    we all went on a party of pleasure to 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app101-f1831"/&gt;
        the baths near Thonon: the
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app101-f1831"/&gt;
    inclemency of the weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In this house I chanced to 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app103-f1831"/&gt;
        find
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app103-f1831"/&gt;
    a 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app105-f1831"/&gt;
        volume
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app105-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app106-f1831"/&gt;
        of the works of Cornelius Agrippa.
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app106-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app107-f1831"/&gt;
        I opened it with
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app107-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app108-f1831"/&gt;
        apathy;
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app108-f1831"/&gt;
    the theory 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app110-f1831"/&gt;
        which
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app110-f1831"/&gt;
    he 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app112-f1831"/&gt;
        attempts
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app112-f1831"/&gt;
    to 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app114-f1831"/&gt;
        demonstrate,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app114-f1831"/&gt;
    and the wonderful facts

        which

        relates,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app118-f1831"/&gt;
    soon changed this feeling into 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app120-f1831"/&gt;
        enthusiasm. A new light

        joy,

        &lt;seg sID="C08_app168-f1831"/&gt;
        was, by returning with greater ardour to my former studies.
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app168-f1831"/&gt;
    It is even 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app170-f1831"/&gt;
        possible,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app170-f1831"/&gt;
    that the train of my ideas 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app172-f1831"/&gt;
        would
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app172-f1831"/&gt;
    never have 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app174-f1831"/&gt;
        received the
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app174-f1831"/&gt;
    fatal impulse 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app176-f1831"/&gt;
        that
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app176-f1831"/&gt;
    led 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app178-f1831"/&gt;
        to my ruin.
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app178-f1831"/&gt;
    But the cursory glance my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was acquainted with  
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app180-f1831"/&gt;
        its
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app180-f1831"/&gt;
    contents; and I continued to read with the  
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app182-f1831"/&gt;
        greatest
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app182-f1831"/&gt;
    avidity. &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p8"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p9"/&gt; When I returned home, my first care was to procure  
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app185-f1831"/&gt;
        the
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app185-f1831"/&gt;
    whole works of this  
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app187-f1831"/&gt;
        author,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app187-f1831"/&gt;
    and afterwards 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app189-f1831"/&gt;
        of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. I read and studied the wild fancies of
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app189-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app190-f1831"/&gt;
        these writers
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app190-f1831"/&gt;
    with 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app192-f1831"/&gt;
        delight;
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app192-f1831"/&gt;
    they appeared to me treasures known to few 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app194-f1831"/&gt;
        beside myself. I have described myself as always having been embued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of nature. In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern philosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied. Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth. Those of his successors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted, appeared even to my boy’s apprehensions, as tyros engaged in the same pursuit.&lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p9"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p10"/&gt;The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him, and was acquainted with their practical uses. The most learned philosopher knew little more. He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery. He might dissect, anatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes in their secondary and tertiary grades were &lt;pb xml:id="F1831_v_043" n="27"/&gt;utterly unknown to him. I had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and ignorantly I had repined.&lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p10"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p11"/&gt;But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew more. I took their word for all that they averred, and I became their disciple.
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app194-f1831"/&gt;
    It may appear 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app209-f1831"/&gt;
        strange that such
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app209-f1831"/&gt;
    should arise in the eighteenth 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app214-f1831"/&gt;
        century;
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app214-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app215-f1831"/&gt;
        but while I followed the routine of education in the schools of Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self taught with regard to my favourite studies. My father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with a child’s blindness, added to a student’s thirst for knowledge. Under the guidance of my new preceptors,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app215-f1831"/&gt;
    I entered with the 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app223-f1831"/&gt;
        greatest
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app223-f1831"/&gt;
    diligence into the search of the  
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app226-f1831"/&gt;
        philosopher’s
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app226-f1831"/&gt;
    stone and the 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app228-f1831"/&gt;
        elixir
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app228-f1831"/&gt;
    of

        life;
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app230-f1831"/&gt;
    but the latter 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app232-f1831"/&gt;
        soon obtained my

        undivided attention.
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app233-f1831"/&gt;
    Wealth was an inferior

        object;
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app235-f1831"/&gt;

    the 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app240-f1831"/&gt;
        discovery,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app240-f1831"/&gt;
    if I could

        banish disease from the human

    and render man

        invulnerable

    a violent  
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app251-f1831"/&gt;
        death!

        visions.
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app253-f1831"/&gt;
    The raising of ghosts or devils 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app255-f1831"/&gt;
        was a promise liberally accorded by
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app255-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app256-f1831"/&gt;

        &lt;seg sID="C08_app257-f1831"/&gt;
        authors,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app257-f1831"/&gt;
    the fulfilment of which I most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app259-f1831"/&gt;
        unsuccessful, I
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app259-f1831"/&gt;
    attributed 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app261-f1831"/&gt;
        the failure
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app261-f1831"/&gt;
    rather to my own inexperience  
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app263-f1831"/&gt;
        and mistake, than to a want of skill or fidelity
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app263-f1831"/&gt;
    in my 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app265-f1831"/&gt;
        instructors.

        &lt;seg sID="C08_app266-f1831"/&gt;
        And thus for a time I was occupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousand contradictory theories, and floundering desperately in a very slough of multifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and childish reasoning, till an accident again changed the current of my ideas.

    we

    our house near

        Belrive,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app308-f1831"/&gt;
    when we witnessed 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app310-f1831"/&gt;
        a most violent and terrible thunder-storm.
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app310-f1831"/&gt;
    It advanced from behind

        the mountains of Jura;
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app312-f1831"/&gt;
    and the thunder

        burst at once

        &lt;seg eID="C08_app317-f1831"/&gt;
    from various quarters of the

        &lt;seg sID="C08_app324-f1831"/&gt;
        lasted,

    watching

        &lt;seg eID="C08_app327-f1831"/&gt;

        door,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app329-f1831"/&gt;

        Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electricity. On this occasion a man of great research in natural philosophy was with us, and, excited by this catastrophe, he entered on the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me. All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa, Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies. It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever be known. All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew despicable. By one of those caprices of the mind, which we are perhaps most subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my former occupations; set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed and abortive creation; and entertained the greatest disdain for a would-be science, which could never even step within the threshold of real knowledge. In this mood of mind I betook myself to the mathematics, and the branches of study appertaining to that science, as being built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration.

        Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments are we bound to prosperity or ruin. When I look back, it seems to me as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life— the last effort made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even then hanging in the stars, and ready to envelope me. Her victory was announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul, which followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting studies. It was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil with their prosecution, happiness with their disregard.&lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p15"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p16"/&gt; &lt;pb xml:id="F1831_v_045" n="29"/&gt;It was a strong effort of the spirit of good; but it was ineffectual. Destiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and terrible destruction.

    I had attained the age of 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app490-f1831"/&gt;
        seventeen,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app490-f1831"/&gt;
    my 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app492-f1831"/&gt;
        parents
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app492-f1831"/&gt;
    resolved that I should  
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app494-f1831"/&gt;
        become a student at the university of Ingolstadt.
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app494-f1831"/&gt;
    I had hitherto attended the schools of 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app496-f1831"/&gt;
        Geneva;
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app496-f1831"/&gt;
    but my father thought it 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app498-f1831"/&gt;
        necessary,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app498-f1831"/&gt;
    for the completion of my 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app500-f1831"/&gt;
        education,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app500-f1831"/&gt;
    that I should be made acquainted with other customs 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app502-f1831"/&gt;
        than those of my native country. My departure was therefore fixed
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app502-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app503-f1831"/&gt;

        &lt;seg sID="C08_app504-f1831"/&gt;

    before the day resolved upon could

        &lt;seg eID="C08_app506-f1831"/&gt;
    the first misfortune of my life 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app508-f1831"/&gt;
        occurred—an omen,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app508-f1831"/&gt;
    as it 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app510-f1831"/&gt;

        Elizabeth
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app514-f1831"/&gt;
    had caught the scarlet 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app516-f1831"/&gt;
        fever; her illness was severe, and she was in the greatest danger.
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app516-f1831"/&gt;
    During her 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app518-f1831"/&gt;
        illness,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app518-f1831"/&gt;
    many arguments had been urged to persuade my mother 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app520-f1831"/&gt;
        to refrain from
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app520-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app521-f1831"/&gt;
        attending
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app521-f1831"/&gt;
    upon her. She 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app523-f1831"/&gt;
        had, at first, yielded
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app523-f1831"/&gt;
    to our 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app525-f1831"/&gt;
        entreaties;
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app525-f1831"/&gt;
    but when she 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app527-f1831"/&gt;
        heard that
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app527-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app528-f1831"/&gt;
        the life of her favourite was
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app528-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app529-f1831"/&gt;
        menaced,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app529-f1831"/&gt;
    she 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app531-f1831"/&gt;
        could no longer
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app531-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app532-f1831"/&gt;
        control her anxiety. She attended her sick bed,—her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity of the distemper,—Elizabeth was saved, but
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app532-f1831"/&gt;
    the consequences of this imprudence were 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app534-f1831"/&gt;
        fatal to her preserver.
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app534-f1831"/&gt;
    On the third day my mother 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app536-f1831"/&gt;
        sickened;
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app536-f1831"/&gt;
    her fever was 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app538-f1831"/&gt;
        accompanied by the most alarming symptoms,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app538-f1831"/&gt;
    and the looks of her 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app540-f1831"/&gt;
        medical attendants prognosticated the
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app540-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app541-f1831"/&gt;
        worst

        &lt;seg sID="C08_app542-f1831"/&gt;
        event.
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app542-f1831"/&gt;
    On her 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app544-f1831"/&gt;
        death-bed
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app544-f1831"/&gt;
    the fortitude and benignity 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app546-f1831"/&gt;
        of
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app546-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app547-f1831"/&gt;

        &lt;seg sID="C08_app548-f1831"/&gt;
        best of women
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app548-f1831"/&gt;
    did not desert her. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app550-f1831"/&gt;
        myself:—“My children,” she said, “my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect of your union. This expectation will now be the consolation of your father.
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app550-f1831"/&gt;
    Elizabeth, my 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app552-f1831"/&gt;
        love, you must
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app552-f1831"/&gt;
    supply my place to 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app554-f1831"/&gt;

        these

        me; I

        ear,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app603-f1831"/&gt;
    can be hushed, never more to be heard. These are the reflections of the first

        days;
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app605-f1831"/&gt;

        evil,

    bitterness of grief

        connection?
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app615-f1831"/&gt;
    and why

        should
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app617-f1831"/&gt;

        may be

    deemed 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app630-f1831"/&gt;
        a sacrilege, is not banished.

    My mother 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app632-f1831"/&gt;
        was

        dead,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app633-f1831"/&gt;
    but we had still duties which we ought to 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app635-f1831"/&gt;
        perform;
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app635-f1831"/&gt;
    we must continue our course with the 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app637-f1831"/&gt;
        rest,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app637-f1831"/&gt;
    and learn to think 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app639-f1831"/&gt;
        ourselves fortunate,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app639-f1831"/&gt;
    whilst one remains whom the spoiler has not seized. &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p3"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p4"/&gt; My  
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app642-f1831"/&gt;
        departure for
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app642-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app643-f1831"/&gt;
        Ingolstadt,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app643-f1831"/&gt;
    which had been deferred by these 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app645-f1831"/&gt;
        events,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app645-f1831"/&gt;
    was now again determined 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app647-f1831"/&gt;
        upon.
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app647-f1831"/&gt;
    I 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app649-f1831"/&gt;
        obtained from my father a respite of some weeks. It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose, akin to death, of the house of mourning, and to rush into the thick of life. I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me. I was unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me; and, above all, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled. &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p4"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p5"/&gt; She indeed veiled her grief, and strove to act the comforter to us all. She looked steadily on life, and assumed its duties with courage and zeal. She devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call her uncle and &lt;pb xml:id="F1831_v_047" n="31"/&gt;cousins.
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app649-f1831"/&gt;
    Never 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app684-f1831"/&gt;
        was she so enchanting as at this time, when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us. She forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget.
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app684-f1831"/&gt;
    &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p5"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p6"/&gt; The day of my departure at 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app686-f1831"/&gt;
        length arrived.
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app686-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app687-f1831"/&gt;
        Clerval spent the last evening with us. He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit him to accompany me, and to become my fellow student; but in vain. His father was a narrow-minded trader, and saw idleness and ruin in the aspirations and ambition of his son.
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app687-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app702-f1831"/&gt;
        Henry
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app702-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app703-f1831"/&gt;
        deeply felt the misfortune of being debarred from a liberal education. He said little; but when he spoke, I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a restrained but firm resolve, not to be chained to the miserable details of commerce.
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app703-f1831"/&gt;
    &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p6"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p7"/&gt; We 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app705-f1831"/&gt;
        sat late. We could not tear ourselves away from each other, nor persuade ourselves to say the word “Farewell!” It was said; and we retired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the other was deceived: but when at morning’s dawn I descended to the carriage which was to convey me away, they were all there—my father again to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to renew her entreaties that I would write often, and to bestow the last feminine attentions on her playmate and friend.
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app705-f1831"/&gt;
    &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p7"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p8"/&gt; I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app720-f1831"/&gt;
        away,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app720-f1831"/&gt;
    and indulged in the most melancholy 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app722-f1831"/&gt;
        reflections. I,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app722-f1831"/&gt;
    who had ever been surrounded by amiable companions, continually engaged in 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app724-f1831"/&gt;
        endeavouring to
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app724-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app725-f1831"/&gt;
        bestow
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app725-f1831"/&gt;
    mutual 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app727-f1831"/&gt;
        pleasure,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app727-f1831"/&gt;
    I was now alone. 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app729-f1831"/&gt;
        In the university,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app729-f1831"/&gt;
    whither I was 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app731-f1831"/&gt;
        going,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app731-f1831"/&gt;
    I must form my own 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app733-f1831"/&gt;
        friends,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app733-f1831"/&gt;
    and be my own 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app735-f1831"/&gt;
        protector.
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app735-f1831"/&gt;
    My life had hitherto been remarkably  
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app737-f1831"/&gt;
        secluded
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app737-f1831"/&gt;
    and 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app739-f1831"/&gt;
        domestic;
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app739-f1831"/&gt;
    and this had given me 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app741-f1831"/&gt;
        invincible repugnance to new
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app741-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app742-f1831"/&gt;
        countenances. I loved my
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app742-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app743-f1831"/&gt;
        brothers, Elizabeth,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app743-f1831"/&gt;
    and 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app745-f1831"/&gt;
        Clerval;
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app745-f1831"/&gt;
    these were “old familiar 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app747-f1831"/&gt;
        faces;”
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app747-f1831"/&gt;
    but I believed myself totally unfitted for the company of strangers. Such were my reflections as I commenced my 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app749-f1831"/&gt;
        journey;
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app749-f1831"/&gt;
    but as I 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app751-f1831"/&gt;
        proceeded,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app751-f1831"/&gt;
    my spirits and hopes rose. I ardently desired 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app753-f1831"/&gt;
        the acquisition of knowledge.
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app753-f1831"/&gt;
    I had 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app755-f1831"/&gt;
        often,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app755-f1831"/&gt;
    when at 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app757-f1831"/&gt;
        home,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app757-f1831"/&gt;
    thought 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app759-f1831"/&gt;
        it
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app759-f1831"/&gt;
    hard  
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app761-f1831"/&gt;
        to remain during my youth
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app761-f1831"/&gt;
    cooped up in one  
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app763-f1831"/&gt;
        place,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app763-f1831"/&gt;
    and had longed to enter  
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app766-f1831"/&gt;
        the
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app766-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app767-f1831"/&gt;
        world,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app767-f1831"/&gt;
    and take my 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app769-f1831"/&gt;
        &lt;pb xml:id="F1831_v_048" n="32"/&gt;station among
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app769-f1831"/&gt;
    other human beings.  
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app771-f1831"/&gt;
        Now my desires were
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app771-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app772-f1831"/&gt;
        complied with,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app772-f1831"/&gt;
    and it 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app774-f1831"/&gt;
        would, indeed,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app774-f1831"/&gt;
    have 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app776-f1831"/&gt;
        been folly to repent. &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p8"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p9"/&gt; I had
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app776-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app777-f1831"/&gt;
        sufficient
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app777-f1831"/&gt;
    leisure for these and many other reflections during my journey to  
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app779-f1831"/&gt;
        Ingolstadt,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app779-f1831"/&gt;
    which was long and 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app781-f1831"/&gt;
        fatiguing.
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app781-f1831"/&gt;
    At length the 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app783-f1831"/&gt;
        high white steeple
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app783-f1831"/&gt;
    of the town met my eyes. I 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app785-f1831"/&gt;
        alighted,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app785-f1831"/&gt;
    and was conducted to my solitary 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app787-f1831"/&gt;
        apartment,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app787-f1831"/&gt;
    to spend the evening as I pleased. 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app789-f1831"/&gt;
        &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p9"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p10"/&gt; The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app789-f1831"/&gt;
    and paid a visit to some of the principal 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app791-f1831"/&gt;
        professors.
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app791-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app792-f1831"/&gt;
        Chance—or rather the evil influence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me from the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father’s door—led me first
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app792-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app793-f1831"/&gt;
        to M. Krempe,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app793-f1831"/&gt;
    professor of 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app795-f1831"/&gt;
        natural philosophy. He
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app795-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app796-f1831"/&gt;
        was an uncouth man, but deeply embued in the secrets of his science. He
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app796-f1831"/&gt;
    asked me several questions concerning my progress in the 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app798-f1831"/&gt;
        different branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy.
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app798-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app799-f1831"/&gt;
        I replied carelessly; and, partly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchymists as the principal authors I had studied.
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app799-f1831"/&gt;
    The professor 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app801-f1831"/&gt;
        stared: “Have you,” he said, “really spent your
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app801-f1831"/&gt;
    time in studying such 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app803-f1831"/&gt;
        nonsense?” &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p10"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p11"/&gt;
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app803-f1831"/&gt;
    I replied in the 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app805-f1831"/&gt;
        affirmative.
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app805-f1831"/&gt;
    “Every

        minute,”
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app807-f1831"/&gt;
    continued M. 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app809-f1831"/&gt;
        Krempe with warmth, “every instant that
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app809-f1831"/&gt;

    which he desired me to

        &lt;seg eID="C08_app868-f1831"/&gt;

        &lt;seg eID="C08_app870-f1831"/&gt;
    after mentioning that

        in the beginning of the

        home,

    not 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app888-f1831"/&gt;
        disappointed,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app888-f1831"/&gt;
    for 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app890-f1831"/&gt;
        I have said that I had long considered
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app890-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app891-f1831"/&gt;
        those

    authors useless

        whom

    the professor 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app895-f1831"/&gt;
        reprobated; but I returned, not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any shape.
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app895-f1831"/&gt;
    M. 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app897-f1831"/&gt;
        Krempe
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app897-f1831"/&gt;
    was a little squat 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app899-f1831"/&gt;
        man,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app899-f1831"/&gt;
    with a gruff voice and 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app901-f1831"/&gt;
        a repulsive
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app901-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app902-f1831"/&gt;
        countenance;
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app902-f1831"/&gt;
    the 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app904-f1831"/&gt;
        teacher, therefore,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app904-f1831"/&gt;
    did not prepossess me in favour of his 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app906-f1831"/&gt;
        pursuits. In rather a too philosophical and connected a strain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come to concerning them in my early years. As a child, I had not been content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural science. With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my extreme youth, and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the steps of knowledge along the paths of time, and exchanged the discoveries of recent enquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchymists.
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app906-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app907-f1831"/&gt;
        Besides,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app907-f1831"/&gt;
    I had a contempt for the uses of modern 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app909-f1831"/&gt;
        natural
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app909-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app910-f1831"/&gt;
        philosophy.
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app910-f1831"/&gt;
    It was very 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app912-f1831"/&gt;
        different,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app912-f1831"/&gt;
    when the 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app914-f1831"/&gt;
        masters of the science sought immortality and
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app914-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app915-f1831"/&gt;
        power;
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app915-f1831"/&gt;
    such 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app917-f1831"/&gt;
        views,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app917-f1831"/&gt;
    although 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app919-f1831"/&gt;
        futile,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app919-f1831"/&gt;
    were 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app921-f1831"/&gt;
        grand:
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app921-f1831"/&gt;
    but now 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app923-f1831"/&gt;
        the scene
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app923-f1831"/&gt;
    was  
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app925-f1831"/&gt;
        changed.
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app925-f1831"/&gt;
    The 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app927-f1831"/&gt;
        ambition of the enquirer
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app927-f1831"/&gt;
    seemed to limit itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in science was chiefly founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of boundless 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app929-f1831"/&gt;
        grandeur
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app929-f1831"/&gt;
    for realities of little worth. &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p13"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p14"/&gt; Such were my reflections during  
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app932-f1831"/&gt;
        the first two or three days of my residence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming acquainted with the localities, and the principal residents in my new abode.
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app932-f1831"/&gt;
    But 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app934-f1831"/&gt;
        as the
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app934-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app935-f1831"/&gt;
        ensuing
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app935-f1831"/&gt;
    week 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app937-f1831"/&gt;
        commenced,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app937-f1831"/&gt;
    I thought of the information 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app939-f1831"/&gt;
        which M. Krempe
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app939-f1831"/&gt;
    had given me concerning the 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app941-f1831"/&gt;
        lectures.
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app941-f1831"/&gt;
    And although I could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentences 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app943-f1831"/&gt;
        out of a pulpit,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app943-f1831"/&gt;
    I recollected what he had said of 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app945-f1831"/&gt;
        M. Waldman,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app945-f1831"/&gt;
    whom I had never 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app947-f1831"/&gt;
        seen,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app947-f1831"/&gt;
    as he had 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app949-f1831"/&gt;
        hitherto been
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app949-f1831"/&gt;
    out of town. &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p14"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p15"/&gt; 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app951-f1831"/&gt;
        Partly from
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app951-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app952-f1831"/&gt;
        curiosity,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app952-f1831"/&gt;
    and partly from 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app954-f1831"/&gt;
        idleness,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app954-f1831"/&gt;
    I went into the lecturing 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app956-f1831"/&gt;
        room,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app956-f1831"/&gt;
    which 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app958-f1831"/&gt;
        M. Waldman
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app958-f1831"/&gt;
    entered shortly after. This professor was 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app960-f1831"/&gt;
        very
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app960-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app961-f1831"/&gt;
        unlike
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app961-f1831"/&gt;
    his colleague. He 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app963-f1831"/&gt;
        appeared about fifty years of age, but with an aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence;
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app963-f1831"/&gt;
    a few 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app965-f1831"/&gt;
        grey
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app965-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app966-f1831"/&gt;
        hairs covered his
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app966-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app967-f1831"/&gt;
        temples,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app967-f1831"/&gt;
    but those at the back of his head were &lt;pb xml:id="F1831_v_050" n="34"/&gt;nearly black. 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app969-f1831"/&gt;
        His person
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app969-f1831"/&gt;
    was 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app971-f1831"/&gt;
        short,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app971-f1831"/&gt;
    but remarkably 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app973-f1831"/&gt;
        erect;
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app973-f1831"/&gt;
    and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard. He began his lecture 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app975-f1831"/&gt;
        by a recapitulation of the
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app975-f1831"/&gt;
    history of  
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app977-f1831"/&gt;
        chemistry,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app977-f1831"/&gt;
    and 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app979-f1831"/&gt;
        the various improvements
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app979-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app980-f1831"/&gt;
        made
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app980-f1831"/&gt;
    by 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app982-f1831"/&gt;
        different
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app982-f1831"/&gt;
    men 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app984-f1831"/&gt;
        of
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app984-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app985-f1831"/&gt;
        learning, pronouncing with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers.
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app985-f1831"/&gt;
    He then took a cursory view of the present state of

        Such were the professor’s words—rather let me say such the words of fate, enounced to destroy me. As he went on, I felt as if my soul were grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were touched which formed the mechanism of my being: chord after chord was sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception, one purpose. So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of Frankenstein,—more, far more, will I achieve: treading in the steps already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.&lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p17"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p18"/&gt;I closed not my eyes that night. My internal being was in a state of insurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I had no power to produce it. By degrees, after the morning’s dawn, sleep came. I awoke, and my yesternight’s thoughts were as a dream. There only &lt;pb xml:id="F1831_v_051" n="35"/&gt;remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies, and to devote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a natural talent. On the same day, I paid M. Waldman a visit.
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app1061-f1831"/&gt;
    His manners in private were even more mild 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app1063-f1831"/&gt;
        and attractive than in public;
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app1063-f1831"/&gt;
    for there was a certain dignity in his 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app1065-f1831"/&gt;
        mien
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app1065-f1831"/&gt;
    during his 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app1067-f1831"/&gt;
        lecture, which in his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness.
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app1067-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app1068-f1831"/&gt;
        I gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had given to his fellow-professor. He heard
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app1068-f1831"/&gt;
    
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app1069-f1831"/&gt;
        with attention the little narration concerning my studies, and
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app1069-f1831"/&gt;
    smiled at the names of Cornelius 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app1071-f1831"/&gt;
        Agrippa
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app1071-f1831"/&gt;
    and 
        &lt;seg sID="C08_app1073-f1831"/&gt;
        Paracelsus,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app1073-f1831"/&gt;
    but without the contempt that

        M.

        task,
        &lt;seg eID="C08_app1086-f1831"/&gt;

    in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of
