        although it is very probable that you will see me before these papers can come into your possession.  Last Monday (July 31st), we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the

        in which she floated. Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we were compassed round by a very thick fog. We accordingly lay to, hoping that some change would <pb xmlns="" xml:id="F1823_v1_041" n="21"/>take place in the atmosphere and weather.  About two o’clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out in every direction, vast and irregular

            <seg xml:id="C05_app8-f1823">

        which seemed to have no end. Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly attracted our attention, and diverted our solicitude from our own situation. We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile: a being which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature, sat in the sledge, and guided the dogs. We watched the rapid progress of the traveller with our telescopes, until he was lost among the distant inequalities of the ice. 
            <pb xmlns="" xml:id="F1823_v1_042" n="23"/>This appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as we believed, many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by ice, it was impossible to follow his track,

        which we had observed with the greatest attention.

             Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied, and consented to come on board. Good God! Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety, your surprise would have been boundless. His limbs were nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering. I never saw a man in so wretched a condition. We attempted to carry him into the cabin; but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air, he fainted. We accordingly brought <pb xmlns="" xml:id="F1823_v1_045" n="26"/>him back to the deck, and restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy, and forcing him to swallow a small quantity. As soon as he
        
        By slow degrees he recovered, and ate a little soup, which restored him wonderfully.  “Then I fancy we have seen him;

        the day before we picked you up, we saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.”  This aroused the stranger’s attention; and he asked a multitude of questions concerning the route which the dæmon, as he called him, had pursued. Soon after, when he was alone with me, he
        </seg>
            <seg xml:id="C05_app20-f1823">
        said, “I

        if I thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed the other sledge? I replied, that I could not answer with any degree of certainty; for the ice had not broken until near midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety before that time; but of this I could not judge.  From this time
