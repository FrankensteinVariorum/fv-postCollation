            <p th:sID="novel1_letter2_div2_p2"/>How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and <seg xml:id="C03a_app1-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C03a_app2-f1823_start"/>snow; <seg xml:id="C03a_app2-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C03a_app3-f1823_start"/>yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a vessel, and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have already <seg xml:id="C03a_app3-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C03a_app4-f1823_start"/>engaged <seg xml:id="C03a_app4-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C03a_app5-f1823_start"/>appear to be men on whom I can depend, and are certainly possessed of dauntless courage.<p th:eID="novel1_letter2_div2_p2"/>
            <p th:sID="novel1_letter2_div2_p3"/>But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy; and <pb n="11" xml:id="F1823_v1_030"/>the absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil. I have no friend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall commit my thoughts to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling. I desire the company of a man who could <seg xml:id="C03a_app5-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C03a_app6-f1823_start"/>sympathize <seg xml:id="C03a_app6-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C03a_app7-f1823_start"/>with me; whose eyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I bitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a friend repair the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution, <pb n="12" xml:id="F1823_v1_031"/>and too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me that I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild on a common, and read nothing but our uncle Thomas’s books of voyages. At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its most important benefits from such a conviction, that I perceived the necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native country. Now I am twenty-eight, and am in reality more illiterate than many <seg xml:id="C03a_app7-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C03a_app8-f1823_start"/>school-boys <seg xml:id="C03a_app8-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C03a_app9-f1823_start"/>of fifteen. It is true that I have thought more, and that my day dreams are more extended and magnificent; but they want (as the painters call it) <hi th:sID="novel1_letter2_div2_p3_hi1"/>keeping;<hi th:eID="novel1_letter2_div2_p3_hi1"/> and I greatly need a friend who would have sense enough not to despise me as romantic, and affection <pb n="13" xml:id="F1823_v1_032"/>enough for me to endeavour to regulate my mind.<p th:eID="novel1_letter2_div2_p3"/>
            <p th:sID="novel1_letter2_div2_p4"/>Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the wide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these rugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage and enterprise; he is madly desirous <seg xml:id="C03a_app9-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C03a_app10-f1823_start"/>of glory. <seg xml:id="C03a_app10-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C03a_app11-f1823_start"/>He is an Englishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices, unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity. I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel: finding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise.<p th:eID="novel1_letter2_div2_p4"/>
            <p th:sID="novel1_letter2_div2_p5"/>The master is a person of an excellent disposition, and is remarkable in the ship for his <seg xml:id="C03a_app11-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C03a_app12-f1823_start"/>gentleness <seg xml:id="C03a_app12-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C03a_app13-f1823_start"/>and the mild<pb n="14" xml:id="F1823_v1_033"/>ness of his discipline. <seg xml:id="C03a_app13-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C03b_app1-f1823_start"/>He is, indeed, of so amiable a nature, that he will not hunt (a favourite, and almost the only amusement here), because he cannot endure to spill blood. <seg xml:id="C03b_app1-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C03b_app2-f1823_start"/>He is, moreover, heroically generous. <seg xml:id="C03b_app2-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C03c_app1-f1823_start"/>Some years ago he loved a young Russian lady, of moderate fortune; and having amassed a considerable sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. He saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in tears, and, throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her, confessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor, and that her father would never consent to the union. My generous friend reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her <seg xml:id="C03c_app1-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C03c_app2-f1823_start"/>lover <seg xml:id="C03c_app2-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C03c_app3-f1823_start"/>instantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his <seg xml:id="C03c_app3-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C03c_app4-f1823_start"/>money, <pb n="15" xml:id="Fv1_1823_034"/>on <seg xml:id="C03c_app4-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C03c_app5-f1823_start"/>which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young woman’s father to consent to her marriage with her lover. But the old man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend; who, when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her inclinations. “What a noble fellow!” you will exclaim. He is so; but then he <seg xml:id="C03c_app5-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C03d_app1-f1823_start"/>has passed all his life on board a vessel, and has scarcely an idea beyond the <seg xml:id="C03d_app1-f1823_end"/>

            <seg xml:id="C03e_app5-f1823_start"/>that perhaps <seg xml:id="C03e_app5-f1823_end"/>
