                  affection, and the excellence of universal virtue. The opinions which naturally spring
                  from the character and situation of the hero are by no means to be conceived as existing
                  always in my own conviction; nor is any inference justly to be drawn from the following
                  pages as prejudicing any philosophical doctrine of whatever kind.&lt;p/&gt;&lt;p/&gt;It is a subject also of additional interest to the author, that this story was begun
                  in the majestic region where the scene is principally laid, and in society which cannot
                  cease to be regretted. I passed the summer of 1816 in the environs of Geneva. The
                  season was cold and rainy, and in the evenings we crowded around a blazing wood fire,
                  and occasionally amused ourselves with some German stories of ghosts, which happened
                  to fall into our hands. These tales excited in us a playful desire of imitation. Two
                  other friends (a tale from the pen of one of whom would be far more acceptable to
                  the public than any thing I can ever hope to produce) and myself agreed to write each a story, founded on some supernatural occurrence.&lt;p/&gt;&lt;p/&gt;The weather, however, suddenly became serene; and my two friends left me on a journey
                  among the Alps, and lost, in the magnificent scenes which they present, all memory
                  of their ghostly visions. The following tale is the only one which has been

                  crew, I felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. I heard
                  of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the happiness

                  You will smile at my allusion; but I will disclose a secret. I have often attributed
                  my attachment to, my passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of the ocean,
                  to that production of the most imaginative of modern poets. There is something at
                  work in my soul, which I do not understand. I am practically industrious—pains-taking;—a
                  workman to execute with perseverance and labour:—but besides this, there is a love
                  for the marvellous, a belief in the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which
                  hurries me out of the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited regions
                  I am about to explore. &lt;p/&gt; &lt;p/&gt;But to return to dearer considerations.

                  in the dark those large loose masses which float about after the breaking up of the

                  the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently talking to some one in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge,
                  like that we had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night, on a large
                  fragment of ice. Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human being within it,
                  whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel. He was not, as the other traveller
                  seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island, but an European. When
                  I appeared on deck, the master said, “Here is our captain, and he will not allow you
                  to perish on the open sea.”&lt;p/&gt;&lt;p/&gt;On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a foreign accent.
                  “Before I come on board your vessel,” said he, “will you have the kindness to inform
                  me whither you are bound?”&lt;p/&gt;&lt;p/&gt;You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction,
                  and to whom I should have supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which
                  he would not have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford. I replied,
                  however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the northern pole.&lt;p/&gt;&lt;p/&gt;Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied, and consented to come on board. Good God!
                  Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety, your surprise
                  would have been boundless. His limbs were nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated
                  by fatigue and suffering. I never saw a man in so wretched a condition. We attempted
                  to carry him into the cabin; but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air, he fainted.
                  We accordingly brought him back to the deck, and restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy,
                  and forcing him to swallow a small quantity. As soon as he

                  by the sympathy which he evinced, to use the language of my heart; to give utterance
                  to the burning ardour of my soul; and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me,
                  how gladly I would sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance
                  of my enterprise. One man’s life or death were but a small price to pay for the acquirement
                  of the knowledge which I sought; for the dominion I should acquire and transmit over
                  the elemental foes of our race. As I spoke, a dark gloom spread over my listener’s
                  countenance. At first I perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed
                  his hands before his eyes; and my voice quivered and failed me, as I beheld tears
                  trickle fast from between his fingers,—a groan burst from his heaving breast. I paused;
                  —at length he spoke, in broken accents:—“Unhappy man! Do you share my madness? Have
                  you drank also of the intoxicating draught? Hear me,—let me reveal my tale, and you
                  will dash the cup from your lips!”&lt;p/&gt; &lt;p/&gt;Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the paroxysm of grief
                  that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened powers, and many hours of repose
                  and tranquil conversation were necessary to restore his composure.&lt;p/&gt; &lt;p/&gt;Having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise himself for
                  being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of despair, he led me again
                  to converse concerning myself personally. He asked me the history of my earlier years.
                  The tale was quickly told: but it awakened various trains of reflection. I spoke of my desire of finding a friend—of
                  my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to
                  my lot; and expressed my conviction that a man could boast of little happiness, who
                  did not enjoy this blessing.&lt;p/&gt; &lt;p/&gt;“I agree with you,” replied the stranger; “we are unfashioned creatures, but half
                  made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than ourselves—such a friend ought to be—do
                  not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures.

                  no cause for despair. But I—I have lost every thing, and cannot begin life anew.”&lt;p/&gt;&lt;p/&gt;As he said this, his countenance became expressive of a calm settled grief, that touched
                  me to the heart. But he was silent, and presently retired to his cabin.&lt;p/&gt;&lt;p/&gt;Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does the beauties
                  of nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions,
                  seems still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth. Such a man has a double
                  existence: he may suffer misery, and be overwhelmed by disappointments;

               <td class="passage">&lt;p/&gt;There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but this circumstance
                  seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection. There was a sense
                  of justice in my father’s upright mind, which rendered it necessary that he should
                  approve highly to love strongly. Perhaps during former years he had suffered from
                  the late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved, and so was disposed to set a greater
                  value on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment
                  to my mother, differing wholly from the doating fondness of age, for it was inspired
                  by reverence for her virtues, and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing
                  her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour
                  to her. Every thing was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience. He strove
                  to shelter her, as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher
                  wind, and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in
                  her soft and benevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto
                  constant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through. During the two years
                  that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all
                  his public functions; and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate
                  of Italy, and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land
                  of wonders, as a restorative for her weakened frame.&lt;p/&gt; &lt;p/&gt;From Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born at Naples,
                  and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remained for several years their
                  only child. Much as they were attached to each other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible
                  stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me. My mother’s tender
                  caresses, and my father’s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me, are my
                  first recollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and something better—their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by Heaven, whom to
                  bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness
                  or misery, according as they fulfilled their duties towards me. With this deep consciousness
                  of what they owed towards the being to which they had given life, added to the active
                  spirit of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during every
                  hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity, and of self-control,
                  I was so guided by a silken cord, that all seemed but one train of enjoyment to me.&lt;p/&gt; &lt;p/&gt;For a long time I was their only care. My mother had much desire to have a daughter,
                  but I continued their single offspring. When I was about five years old, while making
                  an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they passed a week on the shores of the
                  Lake of Como. Their benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages of the
                  poor. This, to my mother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a passion,—remembering
                  what she had suffered, and how she had been relieved,—for her to act in her turn the
                  guardian angel to the afflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings
                  of a vale attracted their notice, as being singularly disconsolate, while the number
                  of half-clothed children gathered about it, spoke of penury in its worst shape. One
                  day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother, accompanied by me, visited
                  this abode. She found a peasant and his wife, hard working, bent down by care and
                  labour, distributing a scanty meal to five hungry babes. Among these there was one
                  which attracted my mother far above all the rest. She appeared of a different stock.
                  The four others were dark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin, and very
                  fair. Her hair was the brightest living gold, and, despite the poverty of her clothing,
                  seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head. Her brow was clear and ample, her
                  blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility
                  and sweetness, that none could behold her without looking on her as of a distinct
                  species, a being heaven-sent, and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.&lt;p/&gt; &lt;p/&gt; The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and admiration on
                  this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history. She was not her child, but the
                  daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother was a German, and had died on giving her
                  birth. The infant had been placed with these good people to nurse: they were better
                  off then. They had not been long married, and their eldest child was but just born.
                  The father of their charge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of the antique
                  glory of Italy,—one among the &lt;hi/&gt;schiavi ognor frementi&lt;hi/&gt;, who exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his country. He became the victim of
                  its weakness. Whether he had died, or still lingered in the dungeons of Austria, was
                  not known. His property was confiscated, his child became an orphan and a beggar.
                  She continued with her foster parents, and bloomed in their rude abode, fairer than
                  a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.&lt;p/&gt; &lt;p/&gt;When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of our villa,
                  a child fairer than pictured cherub—a creature who seemed to shed radiance from her
                  looks, and whose form and motions were lighter than the chamois of the hills. The
                  apparition was soon explained. With his permission my mother prevailed on her rustic
                  guardians to yield their charge to her. They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence
                  had seemed a blessing to them; but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty
                  and want, when Providence afforded her such powerful protection. They consulted their
                  village priest, and the result was, that Elizabeth Lavenza became the inmate of my
                  parents’ house—my more than sister—the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations
                  and my pleasures.&lt;p/&gt;

                  She was docile and good tempered, yet gay and playful as a summer insect. Although
                  she was lively and animated, her feelings were strong and deep, and her disposition
                  uncommonly affectionate. No one could better enjoy liberty, yet no one could submit
                  with more grace than she did to constraint and caprice. Her imagination was luxuriant,
                  yet her capability of application was great. Her person was the image of her mind;
                  her hazel eyes, although as lively as a bird’s, possessed an attractive softness.
                  Her figure was light and airy; and, though capable of enduring great fatigue, she
                  appeared the most fragile creature in the world. While I admired her understanding and fancy, I loved to tend on her, as I should on a favourite animal;
                  and I never saw so much grace both of person and mind united to so little pretension.&lt;p/&gt;

                  Elizabeth as my future wife; a design which she never found reason to repent.&lt;p/&gt;&lt;p/&gt;From this time Elizabeth Lavenza became my playfellow, and, as we grew older, my friend.
                  She was docile and good tempered, yet gay and playful as a summer insect. Although
                  she was lively and animated, her feelings were strong and deep, and her disposition
                  uncommonly affectionate. No one could better enjoy liberty, yet no one could submit
                  with more grace than she did to constraint and caprice. Her imagination was luxuriant,
                  yet her capability of application was great. Her person was the image of her mind;
                  her hazel eyes, although as lively as a bird’s, possessed an attractive softness.
                  Her figure was light and airy; and, though capable of enduring great fatigue, she
                  appeared the most fragile creature in the world. While I admired her understanding and fancy, I loved to tend on her, as I should on a favourite animal; and
                  I never saw so much grace both of person and mind united to so little pretension.&lt;p/&gt;

                  all regarded her became, while I shared it, my pride and my delight. On the evening
                  previous to her being brought to my home, my mother had said playfully,—“I have a
                  pretty present for my Victor—to-morrow he shall have it.” And when, on the morrow,
                  she presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish seriousness,
                  interpreted her words literally, and looked upon Elizabeth as mine—mine to protect,
                  love, and cherish. All praises bestowed on her, I received as made to a possession of my own.
                  We called each other familiarly by the name of cousin. No word, no expression could
                  body forth the kind of relation in which she stood to me—my more than sister, since
                  till death she was to be mine only.&lt;p/&gt;   &lt;head/&gt;CHAPTER II.&lt;head/&gt; &lt;p/&gt; W&lt;hi/&gt;E&lt;hi/&gt; were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in our ages. I need

                  their wandering life, and fixed themselves in their native country. We possessed a
                  house in Geneva, and a campagne on Belrive, the eastern shore of the lake, at the
                  distance of rather more than a league from the city. We resided principally in the
                  latter, and the lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion. It was
                  my temper to avoid a crowd, and to attach myself fervently to a few.

                     My parents were indulgent, and my companions amiable. Our studies were never forced;
                     and by some means we always had an end placed in view, which excited us to ardour
                     in the prosecution of them. It was by this method, and not by emulation, that we were
                     urged to application. Elizabeth was not incited to apply herself to drawing, that
                     her companions might not outstrip her; but through the desire of pleasing her aunt,
                     by the representation of some favourite scene done by her own hand. We learned Latin
                     and English, that we might read the writings in those languages; and so far from study
                     being made odious to us through punishment, we loved application, and our amusements
                     would have been the labours of other children. Perhaps we did not read so many books,
                     or learn languages so &lt;pb xml:id="F1818_v1_062" n="050"/&gt;quickly, as those who are
                     disciplined according to the ordinary methods; but what we learned was impressed the
                     more deeply on our memories.</span> &lt;note/&gt;bad&lt;note/&gt;

                  they were turned, not towards childish pursuits, but to an eager desire to learn,
                  and not to learn all things indiscriminately. I confess that neither the structure
                  of languages, nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states, possessed
                  attractions for me. It was the secrets of heaven and earth that I desired to learn;
                  and whether it was the outward substance of things, or the inner spirit of nature
                  and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me, still my enquiries were directed

                  The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes, and the actions of men, were his theme;
                  and his hope and his dream was to become one among those whose names are recorded in story, as the gallant and adventurous benefactors of our
                  species. The saintly soul of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful
                  home. Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of her celestial
                  eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us. She was the living spirit of love to
                  soften and attract: I might have become sullen in my study, rough through the ardour
                  of my nature, but that she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness.
                  And Clerval—could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval?—yet he might
                  not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his generosity—so full of kindness
                  and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to
                  him the real loveliness of beneficence, and made the doing good the end and aim of
                  his soaring ambition.&lt;p/&gt;

                  the secrets of nature. In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of
                  modern philosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied. Sir
                  Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside
                  the great and unexplored ocean of truth. Those of his successors in each branch of
                  natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted, appeared even to my boy’s apprehensions,
                  as tyros engaged in the same pursuit.&lt;p/&gt;&lt;p/&gt;The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him, and was acquainted with their
                  practical uses. The most learned philosopher knew little more. He had partially unveiled
                  the face of Nature, but her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery.
                  He might dissect, anatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes
                  their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him. I had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed
                  to keep human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and ignorantly
                  I had repined.&lt;p/&gt;&lt;p/&gt;But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew more. I
                  took their word for all that they averred, and I became their disciple.

               <td class="passage">&lt;p/&gt;Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electricity. On this
                  occasion a man of great research in natural philosophy was with us, and, excited by
                  this catastrophe, he entered on the explanation of a theory which he had formed on
                  the subject of electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to
                  me. All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa, Albertus Magnus,
                  and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by some fatality the overthrow of
                  these men disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies. It seemed to me as if nothing
                  would or could ever be known. All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew
                  despicable. By one of those caprices of the mind, which we are perhaps most subject
                  to in early youth, I at once gave up my former occupations; set down natural history
                  and all its progeny as a deformed and abortive creation; and entertained the greatest
                  disdain for a would-be science, which could never even step within the threshold of
                  real knowledge. In this mood of mind I betook myself to the mathematics, and the branches
                  of study appertaining to that science, as being built upon secure foundations, and
                  so worthy of my consideration.&lt;p/&gt; &lt;p/&gt;Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments are we bound
                  to prosperity or ruin. When I look back, it seems to me as if this almost miraculous
                  change of inclination and will was the immediate suggestion of the guardian angel
                  of my life— the last effort made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm
                  that was even then hanging in the stars, and ready to envelope me. Her victory was
                  announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul, which followed the relinquishing
                  of my ancient and latterly tormenting studies. It was thus that I was to be taught
                  to associate evil with their prosecution, happiness with their disregard.&lt;p/&gt; &lt;p/&gt; It was a strong effort of the spirit of good; but it was ineffectual. Destiny was
                  too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and terrible destruction.&lt;p/&gt;

                  to permit him to accompany me, and to become my fellow student; but in vain. His father
                  was a narrow-minded trader, and saw idleness and ruin in the aspirations and ambition
                  of his son. Henry deeply felt the misfortune of being debarred from a liberal education.
                  He said little; but when he spoke, I read in his kindling eye and in his animated
                  glance a restrained but firm resolve, not to be chained to the miserable details of
                  commerce.&lt;p/&gt; &lt;p/&gt;We sat late. We could not tear ourselves away from each other, nor persuade ourselves
                  to say the word “Farewell!” It was said; and we retired under the pretence of seeking
                  repose, each fancying that the other was deceived: but when at morning’s dawn I descended
                  to the carriage which was to convey me away, they were all there—my father again to
                  bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to renew her entreaties
                  that I would write often, and to bestow the last feminine attentions on her playmate
                  and friend.&lt;p/&gt;

                  a child, I had not been content with the results promised by the modern professors
                  of natural science. With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my extreme
                  youth, and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the steps of knowledge
                  along the paths of time, and exchanged the discoveries of recent enquirers for the
                  dreams of forgotten alchymists.

                  to destroy me. As he went on, I felt as if my soul were grappling with a palpable
                  enemy; one by one the various keys were touched which formed the mechanism of my being:
                  chord after chord was sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception,
                  one purpose. So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of Frankenstein,—more, far
                  more, will I achieve: treading in the steps already marked, I will pioneer a new way,
                  explore unknown powers, and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.&lt;p/&gt; &lt;p/&gt;I closed not my eyes that night. My internal being was in a state of insurrection
                  and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I had no power to produce it.
                  By degrees, after the morning’s dawn, sleep came. I awoke, and my yesternight’s thoughts
                  were as a dream. There only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies, and to devote myself to a science
                  for which I believed myself to possess a natural talent.
