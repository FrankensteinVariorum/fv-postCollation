    and 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    some conclusion. Alas! to me the idea of an immediate union with my

    was one of horror and dismay. I was bound by a solemn

    which I had not yet

    and let the monster depart with his 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    from which I expected 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    also the necessity

    of either 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    to  
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    or entering into a long correspondence with 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    philosophers of that  
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    whose knowledge and discoveries

            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and put

    end to my slavery for 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    feelings dictated my answer to my father. I 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    wish  
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    concealing 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    true reasons  
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I clothed my desires under 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
        a guise which excited no suspicion, while I urged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to comply. After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy, that resembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find that I was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey, and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would, before my return, have restored me entirely to myself.<p th:eID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p10"/>
            <p xml:id="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p11">The duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few months, or at most a year, was the period contemplated. One paternal kind precaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion. Without previously communicating with me, he had, in concert with Elizabeth, arranged that Clerval should join me at Strasburgh. This interfered with the solitude I coveted for the prosecution of my task; yet at the commencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be an impediment, and truly I rejoiced that thus I should be saved many hours of lonely, maddening reflection. Nay, Henry might stand between me and the intrusion of my foe. If I were alone, would he not at times force his abhorred presence on me, to remind me of my task, or to contemplate its progress?</p>
            <p th:sID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p12"/>To England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my union with Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return. My father’s age rendered him extremely averse to delay. For myself, there was one reward I promised myself from my detested toils—one consolation for my unparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when, enfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth, and forget the past in my union with her.
        
            <p th:sID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p13"/> I now

            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and would he not accompany me to England? This

    was dreadful in  
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>

    possibility that the reverse of this might happen.

    with the dark Rhine rushing

    where the snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the

    when the wind tore up whirlwinds of

    but this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders. The mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and

    but there is a charm in the banks of this divine

He was a being formed in the <quote xml:id="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p19_quote1">“very poetry of nature.”</quote> His wild and enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart. His soul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of that devoted and wondrous nature that the worldly-minded teach us to look for only in the imagination. But even human sympathies were not sufficient to satisfy his eager mind. The scenery of external nature, which others regard only with admiration, he loved with ardour:— <pb xmlns="" xml:id="F1831_v_154" n="138"/>
