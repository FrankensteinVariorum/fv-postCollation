    at the same

    and it 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    a long time before I learned to distinguish between the

            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I

    so that I was obliged to 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    my eyes. Darkness then came over 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and troubled 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    but hardly had I felt

    opening my

    I

    descended; but 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    found a great

    dark 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my touch or 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I now found that I could wander on at 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    with no obstacles which I could not either surmount or

            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>

        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    the heat wearying me as I 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I sought a place where I could

    shade. This was the forest near

    here

    by the side of a brook

            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I felt tormented by hunger and thirst. This roused me from my nearly dormant

    and I ate some berries which I found 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    on the

    or lying on the

    the

    and then

            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    was overcome by 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    was dark when I

    I felt cold

    and 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    as it were

    finding myself so desolate. Before I had quitted your

    on a sensation of 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I had covered 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    with some 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    but these were 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    to secure me from the 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    miserable 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and could 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    pain invade me on all  
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I sat down and wept. <p th:eID="novel1_letter4_chapter11_div4_div11_p2"/>
            <p th:sID="novel1_letter4_chapter11_div4_div11_p3"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    a gentle light stole over the 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and gave me a sensation of 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I started up, and beheld a radiant form rise 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I gazed with a kind of 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    It moved 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    but it enlightened my 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and I again went out in search of berries. I was still 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    when 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    with which 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    covered myself, and sat down 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    the ground. No distinct ideas occupied my 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    all was 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I felt 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and darkness; innumerable sounds rung in my 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and on all sides various scents saluted 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    the only object that I could distinguish was the bright 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and I fixed my eyes  
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    that with pleasure. 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    changes of day and night 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and the orb of night had greatly 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    when I began to distinguish my sensations 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    the clear stream that supplied me with  
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and the 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    me with their foliage. I was delighted when I first discovered that a pleasant  
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    which often  
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    proceeded from the throats of 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    who 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    often intercepted the light from my eyes. I began also to 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    with 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    the forms that surrounded 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    light which 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the  
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    but was 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    Sometimes I

            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    but the uncouth and  
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    which broke from me

    moon had 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>

            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    while I still remained in the forest. My

    by this

    become 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    received every day  
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    ideas. My eyes became accustomed to the  
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and to perceive objects in their right forms; I 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    the 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    by 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    one herb from 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I found that the sparrow uttered none but harsh 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    whilst 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    the blackbird  
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    were sweet and enticing. 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    when I was oppressed by 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I found a fire 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    had been left by some wandering 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and was 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    with delight 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    from it. In my joy I thrust my hand into the live 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    but quickly drew it 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    with a cry 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    How strange, I thought, that the same cause should 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    examined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I quickly collected some 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    but they were 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and would not burn. I was pained at 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and sat still watching the 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    of the fire. The wet wood 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I had placed near the heat 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and itself  
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I reflected on  
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    by touching the various 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I discovered the 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and busied myself in 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    a great 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    of  
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    that I might dry 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and have a 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    When night came  
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I covered it carefully with 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    spreading my

    I 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    on the 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and sunk into sleep. 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    was morning when I 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and my first care was to visit the 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    uncovered 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I observed this 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and contrived a fan of 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    which roused the embers when 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    were nearly extinguished. When night 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    with 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    that the fire gave light as well as 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    the discovery of this element was useful to me 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    for I found some of 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    offals that the travellers had left had been 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and tasted much more savoury than the berries I 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    to dress my food in the same manner, placing 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    on the live 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I found that the berries <pb xmlns="" xml:id="F1831_v_105" n="89"/>were spoiled by this 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and the nuts 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    much improved. 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    became 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and I often spent 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    day searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger. When I found 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    resolved to quit the place 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I had hitherto 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>

    where the few wants I experienced would be more easily satisfied. In this

    I 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    lamented the loss of

    had obtained 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and knew not how to

    it. 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    serious consideration 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    but I was obliged to 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    to supply 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    myself up in my

    I struck across the wood towards the setting

    I passed three days in these 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and at length discovered the open 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    A great fall of snow had taken place the night 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and the fields were of one

    was 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and I found my feet chilled by the cold

            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    was about seven in the

    and I longed to obtain food and 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    at length I perceived 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    which had

            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    This was a new sight to 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and I examined the

            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I entered. An old man sat

            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    over 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>

    He turned

    perceiving

    somewhat surprised 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    But I was

    the appearance of the

    here the snow and rain could not

    the ground was 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and it 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    to me then as  
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    a retreat as 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    appeared to the

    of hell 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    in the lake of fire. I greedily devoured the

    of the

    which consisted of bread, cheese,

    and 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I did not like. 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    overcome by 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    down among some

    fell asleep. <p th:eID="novel1_letter4_chapter11_div4_div11_p9"/>

    was noon when I 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    allured by the 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I determined to recommence my

    depositing the

    of the

    breakfast in a wallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    at sunset I

    a village. How miraculous did this

    the

    the neater 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    engaged my admiration by 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    The vegetables in the

    the milk and cheese that I saw placed at

    allured 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    One of the best of these I 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    but I had hardly placed my foot

    before the children

    and one of the

            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    The 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    village was 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    some 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    attacked 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    grievously bruised by

    and  
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I escaped to the open

            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    took refuge in a low

    and making a wretched appearance after the

    I had beheld in the village. This

    a cottage of a neat and pleasant

            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I dared not enter it. My place of refuge

            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    so

    was placed on the

    by innumerable

    and 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>

    provided for my sustenance for that

    by a loaf of

    thus

    to reside in this

    looking through a small

    beheld a young

    with a pail on her 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    passing before my hovel. The girl was

    and of gentle

    unlike what I have since found cottagers and

    Yet she was

    a

    petticoat and a linen jacket being her only

    her fair hair was 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    but not adorned; she looked

    yet sad. 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    in

    a quarter of an hour

    returned,

    seemingly incommoded by the

    a young man met

    with  
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    he took the pail from her 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and bore it 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    the cottage himself. She

    and they

    Presently I saw the young man

    out of

    sweeter than the voice of the thrush or

    poor

    who had never beheld aught beautiful before.

    while

    gentle manners of the girl enticed my love. He played a sweet mournful

    which I 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    drew tears from the eyes of

            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    of which the old man took

            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    she sobbed

    He 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and smiled with such

            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    that I felt

    they were a

            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    such as I had never

            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>

    and I

    after this the young man

    The

            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    helped to relieve him of his

    taking some of

    into the

    She seemed 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and went into the garden for 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    roots and 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    which she placed in 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and then upon the

    She 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    continued her  
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    whilst the young man went into the

    and appeared busily employed in digging and 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    he had been employed thus about 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    the young woman joined him, and they 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    the cottage

    old man

    in the mean

    been

    on the

    of 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    he assumed a

    cheerful air, and they sat down to eat.  
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>

    The young woman was again occupied in arranging the 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    the old man walked before the 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    in the sun for a few  
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    leaning on the arm of the

    Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast <pb xmlns="" xml:id="F1831_v_109" n="93"/>between these two 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    One was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming with 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    the younger was 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and graceful in his 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and his 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    were moulded with the finest 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    yet his eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    The old man returned to the cottage; and the

    with tools different from those 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    quickly shut 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    to my extreme 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I found that the cottagers had a means of prolonging 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    by the use of 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and was 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    to 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    that 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    setting of the sun did not put an end 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    the 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    the young girl and her companion were employed in various 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    which I did not  
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and the old man again took 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    which produced 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    divine sounds that had enchanted me in the morning. 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    he had  
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    the youth 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    not to

    but 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    utter

            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    were 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and

    the harmony of the old

    instrument 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    the songs of the

    I since found that he read 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    but at that time I knew nothing of the science of words or letters.  
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    extinguished their 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and retired, as I conjectured, to 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
        rest.
