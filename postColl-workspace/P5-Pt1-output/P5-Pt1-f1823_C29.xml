    as we approached the

    the most delightful scent of flowers and hay. The 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and as I touched the

    I felt those cares and fears 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    which 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and cling to me

        for ever.
