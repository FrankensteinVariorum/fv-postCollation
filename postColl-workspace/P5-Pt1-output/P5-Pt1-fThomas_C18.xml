    What did their tears

    none for

    It was not thus with Felix. He <pb xmlns="" xml:id="F1818_v2_065" n="061"/>was always the saddest of the

    he worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer, 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    he often went

    and did not return

    reading had puzzled me extremely at 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    by 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    as when he 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    that he found on the paper signs for speech which he 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and I ardently 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
        longed to comprehend these also; but how was that possible, when I did not even understand the sounds for which they stood as signs? I improved, however, sensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of <pb xmlns="" xml:id="F1818_v2_067" n="063"/>conversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour: for I easily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to the cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I had first become master of their language; which knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the deformity of my figure; for with this also the contrast perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.  â€œAs the sun became warmer, and the light of day longer, the snow vanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth. From this time Felix was more
        
        and the heart-moving indications of impending famine disappeared. Their food, as I afterwards found, was coarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it. Several new kinds of plants sprung up in the garden, which they dressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season advanced.  â€œMy mode of life in my hovel was uniform. During the
        
        I attended the motions of the cottagers; and when they were dispersed in various occupations, I slept: the remainder of the day was spent in observing my friends. When they had retired to rest, if there was any moon, or the night was star-light, I went into the woods, and collected my own food and fuel for the cottage. When I returned, as often as it was necessary, I cleared their path from the snow, and performed those offices that I had seen done by Felix. I afterwards found that these labours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and once or twice I heard them, on these <pb xmlns="" xml:id="F1818_v2_070" n="066"/>occasions, utter the words <hi xml:id="novel1_letter4_chapter11_div4_div12_p15_hi1">good spirit</hi>, <hi xml:id="novel1_letter4_chapter11_div4_div12_p15_hi2">wonderful</hi>; but I did not then understand the signification of these terms.  â€œThese thoughts exhilarated me, and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring the art of language. My organs were indeed harsh, but supple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease. It was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle
