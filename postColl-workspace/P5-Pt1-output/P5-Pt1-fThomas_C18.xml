    What did their tears

    none for

    which I was

    he worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer,

        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    by 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    as when he 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I

    that he found on the paper signs for speech which he 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and I ardently 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
        longed to comprehend these also; but how was that possible, when I did not even understand the sounds for which they stood as signs? I improved, however, sensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of <pb xmlns="" xml:id="F1818_v2_067" n="063"/>conversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour: for I easily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to the cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I had first become master of their language; which knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the deformity of my figure; for with this also the contrast perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.  “As the sun became warmer, and the light of day longer, the snow vanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth. From this time Felix was more
        
        and the heart-moving indications of impending famine disappeared. Their food, as I afterwards found, was coarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it. Several new kinds of plants sprung up in the garden, which they dressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season advanced.  “My mode of life in my hovel was uniform. During the
        
        I attended the motions of the cottagers; and when they were dispersed in various occupations, I slept: the remainder of the day was spent in observing my friends. When they had retired to rest, if there was any moon, or the night was star-light, I went into the woods, and collected my own food and fuel for the cottage. When I returned, as often as it was necessary, I cleared their path from the snow, and performed those offices that I had seen done by Felix. I afterwards found that these labours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and once or twice I heard them, on these <pb xmlns="" xml:id="F1818_v2_070" n="066"/>occasions, utter the words <hi xml:id="novel1_letter4_chapter11_div4_div12_p15_hi1">good spirit</hi>, <hi xml:id="novel1_letter4_chapter11_div4_div12_p15_hi2">wonderful</hi>; but I did not then understand the signification of these terms.  “These thoughts exhilarated me, and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring the art of language. My organs were indeed harsh, but supple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease. It was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle
