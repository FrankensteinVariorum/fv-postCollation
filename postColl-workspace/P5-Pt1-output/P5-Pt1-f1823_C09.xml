    and manners, but not on that account the less valuable. In M. Waldman I found <pb xmlns="" xml:id="F1823_v1_098" n="79"/>a true friend. His gentleness was never tinged by

    and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and good

    expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress. Two years passed in this

    during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but

    which procured me great esteem and admiration at the university.

    I thought of returning to my friends and

    which had

    any animal endued with life.

    I often asked

        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <pb xmlns="" xml:id="F1823_v1_101" n="82"/>principle of life 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    It was a bold question, and one 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    how many things are we 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    the brink of becoming 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I revolved these circumstances in my 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and determined 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    of natural philosophy which 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and almost intolerable. To examine the causes of 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    we must first have 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    but this was not 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body. In my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my mind <pb xmlns="" xml:id="F1823_v1_102" n="83"/>should 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    supernatural horrors. I do not ever remember 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    trembled at 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    tale of 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    or to have feared the apparition of a 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    Darkness had no effect upon my 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and a 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    was to me merely 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    from being the seat of beauty

    food for the worm. 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    to examine the

    and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and

    My attention was fixed upon every

            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    degraded and  
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I beheld the corruption of death succeed to the blooming cheek of 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    I saw how the  
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    inherited the wonders of the eye and brain. I paused,

    all the minutiÃ¦ of

    as exemplified in the change from life to death,

    to life, 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon
