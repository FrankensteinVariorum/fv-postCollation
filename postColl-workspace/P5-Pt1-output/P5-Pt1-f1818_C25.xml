    We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland

            <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    and conceived an affection for some of the

    and I feared the effects of the

    and tormented me at every moment

    I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace. I waited for my letters with feverish

    if they were

    I was

    I hardly dared to read 
        <seg th:eID="__F" part="F"/>
    my fate. Sometimes I thought that the fiend followed
