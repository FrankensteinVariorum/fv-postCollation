            <p th:sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p25"/>August 13th, 17—.<p th:eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p25"/>
            <p th:sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p26"/>My affection for my guest increases every day. He excites at once my admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree. How can I see so noble a creature destroyed by <seg xml:id="C06a_app1-fThomas_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06a_app2-fThomas_start"/>misery <seg xml:id="C06a_app2-fThomas_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06a_app3-fThomas_start"/>without feeling the most poignant grief? He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated; <seg xml:id="C06a_app3-fThomas_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06a_app4-fThomas_start"/>and when he speaks, in his native language which is French, <seg xml:id="C06a_app4-fThomas_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06a_app5-fThomas_start"/>although his words are culled with the choicest art, yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.<p th:eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p26"/>
            <p th:sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p27"/>He is now much recovered from his illness, and is continually on the deck, apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although un<pb n="032" xml:id="F1818_v1_044"/>happy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery, but that he interests himself deeply in the <seg xml:id="C06a_app5-fThomas_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06a_app6-fThomas_start"/>employments <seg xml:id="C06a_app6-fThomas_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06a_app7-fThomas_start"/>of others. He has <seg xml:id="C06a_app7-fThomas_end"/>
         
            <seg xml:id="C06b_app1-fThomas_start"/>asked me many questions concerning my design; and I have related my little history frankly to him. He appeared pleased with the confidence, and suggested several alterations in my plan, which I shall find exceedingly useful. There is no pedantry in his manner; but all he does appears to spring solely from the interest he instinctively takes in the welfare of those who surround him. He is often overcome by <seg xml:id="C06b_app1-fThomas_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06b_app2-fThomas_start"/>a gloom, <seg xml:id="C06b_app2-fThomas_end"/>

            <del th:sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p27_del1"/>and then he sits by himself, and tries to overcome all that is sullen or unsocial in his humour. These paroxysms pass from him like a cloud from before the sun, though his dejection never leaves him.<del th:eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p27_del1"/> 
            <add th:sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p27_add2"/>Which veils his countenance like deep night—he neither speaks or notices anything around him, but sitting on a gun will gaze on the sea and I have sometimes observed his dark eyelash wet with a tear which falls <del th:sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p27_add2_del1"/>silently<del th:eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p27_add2_del1"/> silently in the deep. This unobtrusive sorrow excites in me the most painful interest, and he will at times reward my sympathy by throwing aside this veil of mortal woe, and then his ardent looks, his deep toned voice and powerful eloquence entrance me with delight.<add th:eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p27_add2"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06b_app3-fThomas_end"/>
         
            <seg xml:id="C06c_app1-fThomas_start"/>I have endeavoured to win his confidence; and I trust that I have suc<pb n="033" xml:id="F1818_v1_045"/>ceeded. One day I mentioned to him the desire I had always felt of finding a friend who might <seg xml:id="C06c_app1-fThomas_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06c_app2-fThomas_start"/>sympathize <seg xml:id="C06c_app2-fThomas_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06c_app3-fThomas_start"/>with me, and direct me by his counsel. I said, I did not belong to that class of men who are offended by advice. “I am self-educated, and perhaps I hardly rely sufficiently upon my own powers. I <seg xml:id="C06c_app3-fThomas_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06c_app4-fThomas_start"/>wish therefore <seg xml:id="C06c_app4-fThomas_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06c_app5-fThomas_start"/>that my companion should be wiser and more experienced than myself, to confirm and support me; nor have I believed it impossible to find a true friend.”<p th:eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p27"/>
            <p th:sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p28"/>“I agree with you,” replied the stranger, “in believing that friendship is not only a desirable, but a possible acquisition. <seg xml:id="C06c_app5-fThomas_end"/>
         
            <seg xml:id="C06d_app1-fThomas_start"/>I once had a friend, the most noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting friendship. You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for despair. But I—I have lost <pb n="034" xml:id="F1818_v1_046"/>every thing, and cannot begin life anew.”<p th:eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p28"/>
            <p th:sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p29"/>As he said this, his countenance became expressive of a calm settled grief, that touched me to the heart. But he was silent, and presently retired to his cabin.<p th:eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p29"/>
            <p th:sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p30"/>Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does the beauties of nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions, seems still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth. Such a man has a double existence: he may suffer misery, and be overwhelmed by disappointments; <seg xml:id="C06d_app1-fThomas_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06d_app2-fThomas_start"/>yet <seg xml:id="C06d_app2-fThomas_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06d_app3-fThomas_start"/>when he has retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit, that has a halo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.<p th:eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p30"/>
            <p th:sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p31"/>Will you <seg xml:id="C06d_app3-fThomas_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06d_app4-fThomas_start"/>laugh <seg xml:id="C06d_app4-fThomas_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06d_app5-fThomas_start"/>at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine wan<pb n="035" xml:id="F1818_v1_047"/>derer? <seg xml:id="C06d_app5-fThomas_end"/>
         
            <seg xml:id="C06e_app1-fThomas_start"/>If you do, you must have certainly lost that simplicity which was once your characteristic charm. Yet, if you will, smile at the warmth of my expressions, while I find every day new causes for repeating them.<p th:eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p31"/>

            <p th:sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p33"/>Yesterday the stranger said to me, “You may easily perceive, Captain Walton, that I <seg xml:id="C06f_app3-fThomas_end"/>

I understand your feeling,” continued he, perceiving that I wished to interrupt him; “but you are mistaken, my friend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my destiny: listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is <seg xml:id="C06h_app4-fThomas_end"/>
