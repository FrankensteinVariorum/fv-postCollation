            <p th:sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p26"/>My affection for my guest increases every day. He excites at once my admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree. How can I see so noble a creature destroyed by <seg xml:id="C06a_app1-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06a_app2-f1831_start"/>misery, <seg xml:id="C06a_app2-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06a_app3-f1831_start"/>without feeling the most poignant grief? He is so <pb n="15" xml:id="F1831_v_031"/>gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated; <seg xml:id="C06a_app3-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06a_app4-f1831_start"/>and when he speaks, <seg xml:id="C06a_app4-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06a_app5-f1831_start"/>although his words are culled with the choicest art, yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.<p th:eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p26"/>
            <p th:sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p27"/>He is now much recovered from his illness, and is continually on the deck, apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although unhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery, but that he interests himself deeply in the <seg xml:id="C06a_app5-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06a_app6-f1831_start"/>projects <seg xml:id="C06a_app6-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06a_app7-f1831_start"/>of others. He has <seg xml:id="C06a_app7-f1831_end"/>
         
            <seg xml:id="C06b_app1-f1831_start"/>frequently conversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him without disguise. He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success, and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken to secure it. I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced, to use the language of my heart; to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul; and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my enterprise. One man’s life or death were but a small price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought; for the dominion I should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race. As I spoke, a dark gloom spread over my listener’s countenance. At first I perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before his eyes; and my voice quivered and failed me, as I beheld tears trickle fast from between his fingers,—a groan burst from his heaving breast. I paused; —at length he spoke, in broken accents:—“Unhappy man! Do you share my madness? Have you drank also of the intoxicating draught? Hear me,—let me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!”<p th:eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p27"/> 
            <p th:sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p28"/>Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened powers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were necessary to restore his composure.<p th:eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p28"/> 
            <p th:sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p29"/>Having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise himself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of despair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally. He asked me the history of my earlier years. The tale was quickly told: <pb xml:id="F1831_v_032" n="16"/>but it awakened various trains of reflection. I spoke of my desire of finding a friend—of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot; and expressed my conviction that a man could boast of little happiness, who did not enjoy this blessing.<p th:eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p29"/> 
            <p th:sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p30"/>“I agree with you,” replied the stranger; “we are unfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than ourselves—such a friend ought to be—do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures.<seg xml:id="C06b_app1-f1831_end"/>
         
            <seg xml:id="C06c_app1-f1831_start"/> 
            <seg xml:id="C06c_app1-f1831_end"/>
         
            <seg xml:id="C06d_app1-f1831_start"/>I once had a friend, the most noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting friendship. You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for despair. But I—I have lost every thing, and cannot begin life anew.”<p th:eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p30"/>
            <p th:sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p31"/>As he said this, his countenance became expressive of a calm settled grief, that touched me to the heart. But he was silent, and presently retired to his cabin.<p th:eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p31"/>
            <p th:sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p32"/>Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does the beauties of nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions, seems still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth. Such a man has a double existence: he may suffer misery, and be overwhelmed by disappointments; <seg xml:id="C06d_app1-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06d_app2-f1831_start"/>yet, <seg xml:id="C06d_app2-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06d_app3-f1831_start"/>when he has retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit, that has a halo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.<p th:eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p32"/>
            <p th:sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p33"/>Will you <seg xml:id="C06d_app3-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06d_app4-f1831_start"/>smile <seg xml:id="C06d_app4-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06d_app5-f1831_start"/>at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine wanderer? <seg xml:id="C06d_app5-f1831_end"/>
         
            <seg xml:id="C06e_app1-f1831_start"/>You would not, if you saw him. You have been tutored and refined by books and retirement from the world, and you are, therefore, somewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit to appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man. Sometimes I have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses, that elevates him so immeasurably above any other person I ever knew. I believe it to be an intuitive discernment; a quick but never-failing power of judgment; a penetration into the causes of things, unequalled for clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression, and a voice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music.<p th:eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p33"/>

            <p th:sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p35"/>Yesterday the stranger said to me, “You may easily perceive, Captain Walton, that I <seg xml:id="C06f_app3-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06f_app4-f1831_start"/>have suffered <seg xml:id="C06f_app4-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06f_app5-f1831_start"/>great and unparalleled misfortunes. I had determined, <seg xml:id="C06f_app5-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06f_app6-f1831_start"/>at one time, <seg xml:id="C06f_app6-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06f_app7-f1831_start"/>that the memory <seg xml:id="C06f_app7-f1831_end"/>

            <seg xml:id="C06f_app9-f1831_start"/>evils should die with me; but you have won me to alter my determination. You <seg xml:id="C06f_app9-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06f_app10-f1831_start"/>seek for <seg xml:id="C06f_app10-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06f_app11-f1831_start"/>knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the gratification <seg xml:id="C06f_app11-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06f_app12-f1831_start"/>of your <seg xml:id="C06f_app12-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06f_app13-f1831_start"/>wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine has been. I do not know that <seg xml:id="C06f_app13-f1831_end"/>

Prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually deemed marvellous.

            <seg xml:id="C06h_app4-f1831_start"/>that I was much gratified by the offered communication; yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes. I felt the greatest eagerness to hear the promised narrative, partly from curiosity, and partly from a strong desire to ameliorate his fate, if it were in my power. I expressed these feelings in my answer.<p th:eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p36"/>
            <p th:sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p37"/>“I thank you,” he replied, “for your sympathy, but it is useless; my fate is nearly fulfilled. I wait but for one event, and then I shall repose in peace. I understand your feeling,” continued he, perceiving that I wished to interrupt him; “but you are mistaken, my friend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my destiny: listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is <seg xml:id="C06h_app4-f1831_end"/>

            <seg xml:id="C06h_app6-f1831_start"/>then told me, that he would commence his narrative the next day when I should be at leisure. This promise drew from me the warmest thanks. I have resolved every night, when I am not <seg xml:id="C06h_app6-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06h_app7-f1831_start"/>imperatively occupied by my duties, <seg xml:id="C06h_app7-f1831_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C06h_app8-f1831_start"/>to record, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during the day. If I should be engaged, I will at least make notes. This manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest <seg xml:id="C06h_app8-f1831_end"/>
